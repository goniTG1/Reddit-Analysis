q60g0w,webbyyy,t3_q60g0w,"Guys, things have got to change.",2021.0,10.0,11.0,"This happened to a friend this weekend. Names and stuff have been changed.

I am sharing this as I think these things need to be shared. It’s 2.12am and I went to a party this evening. I left at 1am hoping to get an Uber as it was late and it’s my safest option but there were literally no Ubers, bolts etc even showing up- very odd. In fact that’s why I was so late leaving as I’d been trying to get a cab back for so long. I didn’t want to walk or get the bus as it was so late. I  walked across the bridge to the bus stop and a friend saw me on her bike and stopped at the bus stop with me until I got on the bus, which was very busy. Two guys were trying to flirt with us at the bus stop and we just ignored them and when my bus came my friend cycled off and we all got on the bus. I had my mask on on the bus and the two guys who had tried to talk to us at the bus stop sat in front of me. They turned around a couple of times and said with grinning faces - alright? I smiled and said yes thanks. When it came to my stop I left it until the last minute to ring the bell- I didn’t want them to know it was my stop. I also left it until the last minute to jump off the bus. I was relieved to see both men still on the bus when it went past me. Whilst walking up my road - in the middle to be safe- I heard someone running up behind me. It was one of the guys from the bus. I said what are you doing. He said he liked me. He had seen where I had gone and got off at the next bus stop to run after me up the road. 

I said very nicely but firmly - and loudly- hoping some of my neighbours might be disturbed- that his behaviour was intimidating and scary and that it’s not appropriate to do what he’s done. He again said- I like you. I told him again that this is not appropriate and that I was on way way home to my husband. He said that he didn’t believe that I had a husband and grabbed my arm and tried to kiss me. I told him very firmly and loudly that he needed to turn around right now and go away in the other direction. He did but I watched until he reached the end of my road until I turned to get to my house- always looking behind me.

I don’t think this man meant anything more sinister than trying his luck but I am enraged at his behaviour. Why can some men not understand that this is not ok -  
What do they think? because a woman on the bus doesn’t tell you to F off that they are automatically attracted to you?  They have no understanding that running up the road after a woman at any time, let alone 1.15 in the morning is terrifying and what on earth makes them think that is acceptable to touch you without any green light?

That's it. \n\nThe problem is that the government, as with most things, are behind, really behind.

This marketing campaign launched a year after they opened up their first office in London.\n\n&gt;[Reddit said the U.K. is home to its second-largest user base, which grew nearly 70% over the past year, calling it “core to our international vision and growth strategy as we scale Reddit’s advertising business globally and attract new users to the platform.”](https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/reddit-sets-up-shop-in-the-uk)\n\n&gt;[The platform said its users in the U.K. spend 33 minutes per day on Reddit, more than any other social platform, with 68% of them between the ages of 18 and 34 and nearly 40% of them women.](https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/reddit-sets-up-shop-in-the-uk)\n\n&gt;[The company added that 26% of U.K. Redditors are not on Instagram and 48% are not on Snapchat.](https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/reddit-sets-up-shop-in-the-uk)', ""Probably for the best that they didn't advertise /r/trees"", 'Cringe', 'I am an advertising executive, and this is some of the worst advertising I\'ve ever seen.

Black and white squares containing strange, cult-like ""Maybe together"" copywriting conventions coupled with weird and obvious puns that don\'t really make much sense to anyone not already \'in the know\'. Then a call to action to, err…? Well, there isn\'t a call to action, just a single word with a mysterious r/ before it.\n\nSo, like, what is this ad supposed to get me to do? What is it trying to sell? Why is it here, now, in front of me? Who is it for? There\'s an element of \'together\'ness but who is getting together?

q15o92,[deleted],t3_q15o92,London is not welcoming to people going out alone.,2021.0,10.0,4.0,"Lifelong Londoner here. Nowadays my friends are almost all married or in long-term relationships. They’re typically free to hang out as a group once a month or so.

I’m trying to find new friends through social groups, but I find myself having to make my own plans most of the time.

I go to pubs, restaurants, museums, exhibitions etc alone often. 

Last weekend I felt an urge to go “out out” since I hadn’t in what felt like ages! I headed into central London and tried to get into a few bars and clubs.

I was refused entry to 2 bars and all 3 nightclubs I tried on the basis that they “don’t accept single entries”.

That was both disheartening and also really embarrassing, it’s awkward enough queueing alone without the bouncers loudly announcing they’re not letting in single people!

Has anyone else experienced this and what suggestions would you have for someone in my position?

EDITs:

- saying my friends are inside doesn’t work, bouncers say they have to come to the door.

- I dress well and am not some sort of scary or threatening looking person.

- I already have hobbies, I’m not trying to use going out as my only way of socialising or meeting people.

- I’m non-white (black) for those who have asked. I realise this could be a factor but didn’t want to mention it earlier and send thread into a tailspin with people arguing about extraneous issues.

- Appreciate everyone’s suggestions! I’m going to try a lot of what people have submitter.

n29lsz,thevileswine,t3_n29lsz,Met a real hero tonight and couldn't even buy him a beer!,2021.0,5.0,1.0,"On my way back from the shops I was grabbed by a (i think due to accent) Polish bloke wearing typical builders gear. He was a bit panicked and asking me for the number for Uber or a cab firm in the area, having headphones in and not paying attention I replied ""uber  is phone app based and there's a taxi office over there"" pointing in direction. The bloke pointed to an older east asian man (late 50s/early 60s) slumped at the bus stop and said ""this guy something wrong, I call ambulance and it not come yet, he want go home"". 

I'm first aid trained so had a quick look, the chap was shivering and very confused, pulse and heartbeat and breathing seemed ok. An ambulance whizzed past and turned a few meters from where we were, my new Polish pal said ""This the one i call for him!"" and sprinted off Usain Bolt speed after it. I stayed with the older guy making sure he was ok and didn't bite his tongue as he was on verge of fitting. The chap was shaking very badly and took my 6'2 95 kilo frame to keep the fella upright and semi cohesive, he kept saying he was cold. I clocked he was having a hypoglycemic episode, thankfully my new polish pal sprinted back and said ""ambulance got wrong and is turning now"" so I dashed across the road to get redbull from my usual shop to get some sugar into the fella. I literally ran in, grabbed 2 cans ans shouted I'd pay tomorrow, the guys there know me so it was fine. Start forcing redbull into the guy while my new polish pal was holding him up, he started being a bit more coherent 45 seconds later and the ambulance showed up a minute later. Ambulance dudes jump out and start asking the prelim questions 'do we know him' etc but obvs we didn't. Told the ambulance guy I suspected hypoglycemia (been a type 1 diabetic for 30 plus years so know the symptoms) so i forced redbull on him. Confirmed in ambulance with a very quick prick test he was fatality low on blood sugars. The awesome polish chap, who kinda saved the guys life,  just patted me on the shoulder and said ""nice one buddy, I need get home"" and dashed off before ambulance even left.

o50u8t,SouthernDaikon,t3_o50u8t,Sexual assault in Peckham Rye!,2021.0,6.0,21.0,"Hi. I'm an east Asian female in my 20s(5'3"") and was sexual assaulted around Peckham Rye last weekend. I wanted to share my story so nothing like this would happen again!

I'm currently working at a bar for the weekends around Peckham Rye lane and I live 15 minutes walk away. I got off around 1:30 and was walking home.

A young black guy, thin and wearing a black jacket and black trousers, started following me, calling me ""Miss. Excuse me, miss"" but I thought I've misheard it and carried on. He eventually stopped me and said, ""I just wanted to let you know you're really pretty."" I answered Thank you, and ignored him, and walked fast.

But he followed me asking my name and where I'm from, and also where I'm going right now. I answered ""I'm going home"" -- he replied, ""Are you inviting me?"" I answered ""No. I have flatmates""

I kept following me so I've texted my flatmates to come out at a porch and the front of our house. He stopped me again and asked me if he could see my hands. I asked ""What for?"" and he said, ""To show my dick."" I said no, and walked really fast.

He crossed the street and went past me for 50m, so I thought he's lost interest in me. But then he crossed the road again and went into a smaller street.

While I was passing that street, I could see him standing at the junction, and wanking off on the street, facing me!! I got scared but ignored him, and carried on. Luckily, my flatmate(who's a white male over 6'1"") was waiting for me outside, and the black guy wasn't following me afterward.

I reported the police after I got home, and they've actually caught the guy after about 30 minutes! A police officer also came over to take my statements around 3 o'clock. I was surprised by how efficient they are.

I might be visiting a police station this or next week to identify him, but the officers are pretty sure they've got the right guy. Even worse, this guy already committed multiple offenses!!

I'm glad that he got caught, but I hope nothing like this would ever happen. Be careful everyone and always report suspicious activities!

Edit: I didn't know this would get so many upvotes! I know Peckham can be a bit shady, but I've just moved here 2 months ago and can't afford to move to somewhere else or just quit the job. I've talked with the bar owners and they will take me home or pay for Uber from now on. I thought it'd be fine since it's just 15 minutes walk but I was wrong.

I'm from where police officers don't give a fuck about sexual harassment or domestic violence. Made a few police reports in my life but never had good results back in my home country. So I was genuinely surprised by London officers. Maybe they're more vigilant than ever due to the Sarah \*Everard\* (edited) tragedy?

Anyway, I drew what he looked like just in case and I'll share it with you guys. He had a distinctive hairstyle, and a phone case, which was blue with a diamond-like pattern.

Edit 2: Please recommend me some 'felt cute might report you later' personal alarms. If I have to be prepared, I want to be prepared in style.

Edit 3: First, Sorry for misspelling Sarah Everard!

A few updates on how the officers caught this guy: since he was following me from Nigel Road to East Dulwich, there were several witnesses from the windows who's seen the interaction. This guy is currently bailed out but told not to walk around this area(although I don't know how that's assuring?)

Also, sorry for the confusion I've made on listing all the people's races on this post. I thought I should give every detail about this incident. Again: the perp was a young black guy, possibly in his early 20s, about 5'4""\~5'5"" and very skinny(weighs less than 60kg maybe?), had dreadlocks and it was a big hair, big eyes, black jacket, trousers, shoes, and distinctive blue-hued diamond-like patterned phone case. the Phone case had multiple colors based on the blue hue.

I do think the main reason I was targeted was that because I'm a short East Asian female -- a lot of people think we wouldn't do anything, or even not call for help due to language barrier or something. I also thought texting (I've managed to text my flatmates for help in the middle of that conversation!) my flatmates will be a lot safer because, yes, they're tall white guys. Nothing sketchy ever happened to my flatmates and I thought the perp might just walk away if somebody was searching for me on the street.

To design, procure and construct a new neighbourhood like nine elms is insanely expensive and at this level the margins are thin and liability is huge, so the “private market” units are as expensive as possible so that the main developer can turn a profit.\n\nMixing these two uses in a building presents difficulties in legal boundaries and domains. Where does one begin and one end? What percentage lobby is private market / affordable rent based on service charge paid? Fire regulations mean that one lobby can only serve one block and a certain number of people. In this way, Lobbies usually can’t be shared because people have paid different rents and fees; and usually private / affordable have different stair cores because of fire regulations (there might be too many units sharing a single core so two are necessary). It is therefore easier legally and safer regulation-wise to make them separate entrances.\n\nTypically, because of the numbers of units, the affordable units are in one block, and private are in another block. This literally means separate entrances are required. The RSL that buys the affordable units off the main developer can arrange for a higher level of fit out depending on their brand image. As far as the main developer is concerned, they will build the affordable units to the high standard agreed with an RSL and hand them over on the agreed date. The finish is agreed with the RSL and paid for by them.', 'I literally do not give a shit. Like not at all.

p8sdi7,_MR_POSITIVITY_,t3_p8sdi7,"I posted a week ago about how I was going to go up to strangers and ask to be friends, here's how it went...",2021.0,8.0,21.0,"Old thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/p374ff/just_moved_to_london_dont_know_anyone_and_am/


To preface this, I'm very introverted but am new to the area and wanted to have friends. After lockdown, I also wanted to get out of my comfort zone and do something ""crazy"" (pretty sad state of affairs when society stigmatizes speaking to strangers) but anyways.

In short it went incredibly well.

I must have spoken to well over 30 complete strangers this week. The results are that I'm now a part of 5 or so different social circles of people who I genuinely think I will vibe with.

With some strangers, they were either on holiday or I didn't feel like we vibed in which case I kept the conversation short. Don't get me wrong, there was a fair share of people who said some variation of ""I can't speak to you right now"". After they said that, I realized I was still alive, unscathed and felt no embarassement. Shock horror. There's 101 reasons why they weren't up for a chat in that moment and that's okay. So I went up to the next stranger and repeated the process.

A few examples of interactions:

I went to a popular doughnut shop the other day by myself, long queue. Started talking to a group of people who were in front of me, made casual chat and said I'm new to the area and wanna make new friends. Guess what? We exchanged numbers and grabbed food together a few days later so that's one more social circle I'm a part of now.

I went to get my covid second jab yesterday and spoke to the girl who was in front of me. I complimented her outfit, we started talking and clicked well so exchanged numbers. We're planning to meet midweek for a drink.

I went for a walk and saw two guys chilling out in a ""hub"" square, went to ask them recommendations for local pubs because again, I'm new to the area. I don't want to spend hours on the internet looking for places when I could just ask locals (and of course see if we gel in which case become contacts). Again, our conversation flowed so we exchanged numbers and will definitely be meeting up again.

Another day I was heading home so needed to catch the tube. Instead of checking my phone for directions and staying in my own bubble, I forced myself to ask someone for the way instead. Ended up speaking to an Italian student who was lost himself and we had a pretty funny chat. We've made plans to go out for drinks next weekend with his uni friends who are an international bunch.

I should also probably say that I'm pretty young myself, so maybe it's less weird for me to have done what I did? 

In any case, when I made that original thread, it blew my mind that people mostly reacted in a way as if I was planning to take a shit in their morning cuppa. I wanted to prove them wrong.

I wanted to share my experience because it's been incredible life experience. I've never done this before but it did wonders for my confidence. I'll be out today and tomorrow with people I've already met but if I see another stranger who I think might be cool, I know I'll have aboslutely zero issues with striking up a conversation with them.

TLDR: If you want to make friends, talk about absolutely anything with the next stranger that you think you might get along with. If they're not into it, wish them a good day.

""freedom day"" meant that the government doesn\'t need to help in case of inability to work due to covid, for example, or that a business doesn\'t have to put their employers in a safe covid environment, etc. there\'s a reason why pandemic or emergency statuses are declared. it\'s for these safeguards that benefit a population. but in the UK we only saw the bad side of it.\n\nI\'m not against the lifting of restrictions. but the way most of you embraced it without understanding these things... was a bit worrisome to me.\n\nEverything I did this last year and a half was to be able to have this trip to Portugal in a safe way. I\'ve had family members and friends die, not covid-related, which I couldn\'t visit to give my last goodbyes. I\'ve seen my nephew and niece turn from 4 year old incomprehensible toddlers to first-day-at-school excited kids with long legs. all this time, I\'ve waited my turn to be fully vaccinated and had a very careful approach to my day to day... all so that I could be with my parents almost two years since I last saw them. and the behaviour I would see daily from a vast number of people in London just depressed me. I think that everyone should do what they feel comfortable doing. I understand people that don\'t wear masks, or don\'t want to get vaccinated. I don\'t agree with them - at all - but I understand the concern, the fear, the distrust, all those reasons. but it\'s so depressing to feel some of us are doing a sacrifice while the rest just doesn\'t care.', ""To be fair at this stage it really doesn't make the same difference now we have abandoned any other controls, everyone is going to catch covid at some point over the next 12 months if you haven't already and we have relaxed so much the few restrictions that are left are totally pointless. \n\nThat's just the choices that have been made, if you aren't going down New Zealands total exclusion route then you just can't control it so all you are doing is preventing people getting critically ill with the vaccine, and if they still do having better drugs and enough ICU capacity to cope. \n\nAll mask wearing does is offset the rate at which everybody catching it happens and that isn't simple. If you are fully vaccinated(and relatively recently) otherwise fit and healthy it might actually be better to catch it now than when winter gets to its peak or your protection from the vaccine drops. There is obviously an argument about people that are compromised should be protected and going into a stressed winter you want to actually suppress flu as much as covid, but its just that an arguement."", ""I wear a mask most days on the tube, however, I can see why people are not wearing one.

The best way to implement them would be a similar scheme to the cycle hire, with stations around the place so you don't have to take them on the train.

q5chb7,PiranhaPony,t3_q5chb7,Late night transport options - no taxis / night buses / night tubes!,2021.0,10.0,10.0,"I had a night out this weekend, my first late one in a long time.  I was out in Covent Garden, and I live in West Hampstead. 

I was trying to get home from 2am. Uber wasn't bringing anything up. Bolt wasn't bringing anything up. Both just kept ""matching me with a driver...""  

I knew from prior experience that the night tube wouldn't be running, even though I'd usually rely on it. I walked along the Strand / down to Charing Cross / up to Oxford Street, and there were no black cabs to be had.  Any I did see (2 with their lights on in approximately 70 minutes of searching) were very very quickly snapped up. 

OK, fine, I'll get the 139 night bus. Except nope, that's not running either. It's rapidly approaching 3am. 

OK fine, maybe I'll walk to Farringdon or City Thameslink and get one of those trains. Nope, none til 4.45am. 

I saw one other woman also desperately trying to get home. She was actually standing IN the road on Oxford Street trying to flag down *any* car / van. She eventually gave up and wandered off. There were a couple of guys falling asleep on a bench. There were huge crowds around bus stops, but lots started wandering away after a few minutes when they realised the one they needed obviously wasn't running. 

In the end, I had to go back to my office and wait it out there until the Thameslink started running - luckily I had a key card with an alarm fob with me, but if I hadn't I'd have had to spend a couple of hours walking home on my own in the middle of the night. It did shake me up a bit that there was no reasonable and safe way of getting home. I had Bolt and Uber searching for drivers consecutively for 50 minutes with no luck. Especially as a solo woman, after everything that happened with Sarah Everard, it really gave me pause for thought. Is it too risky to go out now if there is no safe, reliable way of getting home? When are they going to start running the night buses and tubes again? What was with the severe lack of transport options that night?

I grew up in a rural area where it was easy to get stranded. I never thought it would happen to me in central London! And I certainly wasn't the only one stuck. Has anyone else had this recently? I'm honestly a bit worried to go out late in central now!

***Edit / Update***

Wow this blew up a bit, I didn't expect such a response.  I'll try and cover a few of the more common points / questions below: 

- First of all I'm sorry to hear lots of other people have been experiencing this. It's a horrible sinking feeling when you start to think 'Shit, maybe I can't get home'. If you work in central late at night or live further out, you have my absolute sympathy. There were obviously a lot of other people in a similar situation when I was there. 

- I am not in the habit of being out late in central in the early hours of the morning on my own, and I was reasonably sober at the time. I mentioned this down-thread (probably lost by now), but it was a corporate event which ran late and I had to stick to the client's timetable. Unfortunately for me the client fancied a late evening. I was extremely conscious of the time! I am usually an in-bed-by-11pm-even-if-you-can-get-me-out-of-the-house-in-the-first-place person. But even if I was in the habit of getting blind drunk in Soho every weekend til 3am, I'm not sure it's unreasonable to believe you can rely on at least one of several transport options in a major capital city. 

- It was Friday night.

- Thank you to those who have suggested different apps - I'll go through the list now and start downloading them. 

- Thank you as well to those who have suggested places to hang out in future. The casinos could have been quite fun! I'm not a gambler and don't go in them usually, so I wouldn't really know they're open 24 hours. As long as I have my alarm fob then my office is a reasonably close, safe alternative where I can sit and charge my phone and do a little work with a cup of tea. I appreciate that's not an option for many. 

- No, I couldn't get a black cab. They were around but in VERY high demand and had their lights off. In my wanderings I saw two with their lights on, both of which were too far away from me to get to before others did.

- My firm is quite small and to my knowledge we don't have a corporate Addison Lee account. Even if we had though, I was tied in to whenever the client was done so it would have been hard to book ahead.  

- Yes, night buses were running - I never said they weren't - but the 139 (which is the one I needed and which I mentioned initially) did not seem to be. It's a 24 hour bus and is usually reliable every half hour. I went to two of the 24-hour stops outside Charing Cross and down the Strand, and waited for a while to watch the boards, but at neither stop was it showing as arriving in the next 45 minutes. After that the boards ran out of room for later buses, but TFL's live arrivals portal on their website wasn't showing me any different, and given it's supposed to be every 30 minutes it was not promising. I considered walking down to Waterloo where it starts from but that would have taken me further away from my office, which I knew was a last resort. 

- I did not book a hotel, because I didn't expect to be late out and because I don't consider West Hampstead to be in the arse end of nowhere (opinions may vary).

- I would not really have felt safe trying to walk or cycle home, or that confident I could do it without getting lost. Once I get to St John's Wood I'm OK, but between central and there it could have been easy for me to take a wrong turn. Google maps tells me walking home from central is 1hr 36 minutes, which is a hell of a long time to be walking at night on your own as a woman.",1405.0,0.98,321.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"[""Worst case scenario there are a few 24hr restaurants, Polo Bar, VQ and, duck and waffle although quite expensive.\n\nIt's very annoying not having the night tube, wish London would become a 24 hour city but without transport it's impossible."", ""I had a similar experience after the final of the Euros. \n\nI ended up having to get an Uber bicycle and cycle from Holloway back to Queen's Park. \n\nDo you have citymapper?

phngsv,[deleted],t3_phngsv,Surreal incident in Islington.,2021.0,9.0,4.0,"The other night I was walking home from a meeting I had in Islington, it was like 9:00 PM or something, I was walking to get the number 30 bus - this wasn't unusual, a lot of meetings I have are in pubs in Islington (I'm a filmmaker and informal settings like pubs are pretty commonplace for meetings). 

I was walking to the bus stop when a car literally pulls up beside me and asks ""Are you lost mate?"" to which I replied ""No mate, I know where I'm going"" and I begin to walk off and then I can almost sense him following me in his car - he then stops beside me again  and asks ""Are you a copper? Are you a coppers snitch?"" to which I was like ""No I'm not, I'm just walking home"" - so by this point, I'm freaking out completely, I have no idea what I've done wrong or why this person is talking to me, I'd been in this area a hundred times before and never had any issues, so by this point I'm pretty much in fight or flight but I've decided to hold my ground, I'm not gonna give the impression that I'm timid or a walkover, because I'm not. The next bit catches me off guard and he says ""You look like a queer, do you like to suck c\*\*k?"" I was like ""Mate, you're barking up the wrong tree"" - I really didn't know what to say to him because inside I was freaking out he then goes ""What the fuck are you doing here? Are you a snitch?"" I then replied in the negative, and he continues to ask what I'm doing and if I'm lost etc by this point I'm realising that this is going on a bit long and if something was going to happen it would have probably have happened by now so I begin to walk off and I say ""Whatever, fuck off pal"" and as I'm walking off I hear him say ""Get the fuck out of here"".  


I walk off and he's pulled up down a road and he's talking to another fella, but they seem to already know each other quite well, well enough to have a seemingly calmer conversation then the one I just had with him - he then says ""That's him there, that's one of them"". I literally have no idea what he was on about. 

So I get to my bus stop - he's at the traffic lights right next to my bus stop, he's staring me out and nodding with a smirk on his face, I'm looking at him not breaking eye-contact I'm stood up straight and I'm not coming across intimidated, he then drives off and that was the end of that.

From talking to him I got the sense that he was coked up, he was talking in way that wasn't loud but rushed and pretty aggressive (If that makes sense) - he was constantly sniffling and wiping his nose. I really can't make sense of the situation, like I've been running over all possibilities in my head, I literally have no idea what I did wrong? Why I was targeted? And weirdly, why something more violent/sinister didn't occur? As far as I'm aware, no crime was actually committed - I'm not physically hurt but mentally I feel a little shaken - I've lived in London for some time now and this is the first time anything like this has happened to me and really the first time I've ever actually felt in some form of danger. 

Has anything like this happened to anyone here? Is it some kind of distraction con? I wasn't robbed or even physically attacked - it just doesn't make any sense considering I was just walking. 

Thanks in advance.

owal4u,AnilDG,t3_owal4u,Attempted Phone Theft on the Tube - Stay Aware,2021.0,8.0,2.0,"Petty Theft is rampant in London, but I saw a worrying attempt at phone theft yesterday at Caledonian Road station.

Two guys were stalking the platforms and then tried to grab a phone out of a lady's hands before the door closed and the train departed. I've seen phone theft on the Tube before, but usually it's an attempted mugging. The victim in this instance was not facing the platform so had no idea that someone would attempt to steal their phone, and she looked pretty shocked as the train left the station. Luckily the attempted thieves couldn't get the phone out of her hands so she had a lucky escape.

Unfortunately there are a lot of scumbags out there so stay vigilant when using your phone, and try to keep an eye out on your surroundings.",1219.0,0.98,311.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"['Be very careful with your phones on the Euston Road. Moped thieves will snatch them out of your hand while you are distracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit - Infact, just be very careful wherever you are with your phone out. There are opportunists everywhere. Be wary of your surroundings whilst you have your phone out.', 'A few tips from someone just back from living in a European country where moped snatching style crime is rampant.\n\n Always be aware of your surroundings when you get your phone out. If you really really need your phone out in public, like to check directions or communicate with someone you’re meeting, the safest way is to turn and face a wall and hold the phone with both hands to use it. \n\nIf you have a backpack, put it on properly with a strap on each shoulder so it’s harder to grab. If it has easy-to-open zips and pouches there are times I would recommend wearing it on the front. If you have a one-shoulder bag, angle it so it’s in front of your body so you can see anyone trying to approach it.\n\nIf you get your bag snatched by a moped driver, let go. It’s shit to see someone get all your stuff but getting dragged along the ground behind a motorbike is even more shit. Some people carry knives to make cutting the straps off someone’s bag easier so I would advise against confronting them too.\n\nOh and a final one from me that I learnt the painful way. If you have an iPhone, do NOT make your unlock code your birthday. That information is accessible via the unlock screen (your emergency contact information has your name, dob, blood type, etc) and if the thieves can unlock your phone they can get into all of your shit including your Apple Pay cards, your email accounts, etc etc etc. For similar reasons I would advise having your 2FA phone number as a different one to the one you use to access your accounts. \n\nI would also advise having find my iPhone or the android equivalent set up. In the country I was living in, it was common to ransom phones back for cash if they couldn’t unlock them. It’s sometimes worth putting a message on saying ‘return for reward’ with a contact number if you don’t have insurance and are desperate to get it back. Then obviously meet them with a friend in a well lit public place to do the exchange. I mean in the uk it’s probably more sensible to just get gadget insurance.', ""My phone got stolen at Newington Green (Islington, bordering Hackney) last September on my way to work, around 08:30 in the morning. I was texting and walking to the bus stop and before you know it, my phone was in a hands of a motorcyclist and I was too stunned to do anything so I just walked home, absorbed from the shock. I went to the police station to report the crime and thankfully, they found the thief and he was sentenced to prison. Turns out he was a youth offender who was driving a stolen vehicle and he had stolen about sixty phones. I can't believe this occurred almost a year ago and now, if I do have my phone out on the street (let's be real, it's impossible to swear you will never bring your phone out in public again, I am very defensive on victim blaming), I carry it with both hands or I step away from the pavement so I am not in reach of motorcyclists. Sometimes I get a bit jumpy when someone on a scooter or even a jogger swiftly goes past me.  \n\n\nI'm very lucky that my case was successful as victims are often ignored when it comes to procedure of crime and this is a petty crime, I acknowledge it could've been much worse but it does feel like such a violation of your personal space.

The carriage was otherwise empty around us, maybe  a couple of people sitting down. A guy (who was clearly having a bad day by the look of his freshly beaten up face) stood next to her, put his hand in her handbag and started fishing around, somehow without her noticing. \n\nThe three of us stepped in on all sides and he quickly backed away and ran off down the carriage without getting anything, but it was crazy that because he acted so nonchalently it wasn't immediately obvious to my ex what he was up to, even after standing so close in a mostly empty carriage."", 'Cally road is a lift station too - what are the muggers doing?

They’d be like zombies in the pret every morning. Passed out on benches and doorways outside. Very tragic. \n\nI met up with a friend in a bar in kings cross and caught an obvious alcoholic with his hand in my bag attempting to mug me. \n\nI shrug my shoulders a lot when people say London is unsafe as normally I feel pretty safe in London. But with substance addiction and homelessness comes desperation, and that makes people pretty dangerous at times.

I've stopped maybe 7 or so phone thefts mainly around central and east London, most in bars and a couple on the bus, just by running over or shouting at the driver to stop etc. These people were not alone and have very specific ways of working. Ugh. I just thought of another time a guy pickpocketed me as I left the bus, but I realised and went back to the bus, stopped it and got my phone back.

m7amn0,shak_0508,t3_m7amn0,I was held at knife point for the first time today.,2021.0,3.0,17.0,"I was on my way home today from Tesco. Turned into my road and a guy with a mask on started getting closer to me with his bike. He asked me where I'm from and I replied that I live locally. He then asked if he could see the time on my phone. I replied that I didn't have my phone on me and tried walking away. He told me to stop lying,  then pulled out a huge knife and that's when I began shitting myself. I apologised and  was about to take out my phone. Luckily, a few guys were walking past and yelled, then the guy decided to ride off. A huge relief. All in all, the encounter probably lasted around a minute or 2. 

I always hear stories of this kind of thing and people calling London a shithole, but could never relate because nothing like this had ever happened to me.

Everyone always has an idea of what they'd do in a situation like this, myself included. However, that completely went out the window for me. Seriously thought he'd stab me when he pulled out what was essentially a sword.

Edit: I've had a few people ask where the incident happened. Happened in Islington very close to Holloway road station. Since the exact location is only a minute from my house, don't wanna give the exact location for obvious reasons. Happened on a side road pretty close to the main road. It was around 7:30pm. The guy in this case was black. I'm estimating his age to be anywhere from 17-23, based on height, voice, clothing and choice of language. Couldn't see his face or hair, so that's all I have to go on.

Post-pandemic, I was so hopeful. Enthusiasm for people-centric urban environments and non-car forms of personal transportation seemed higher than ever. Finally, we would flip the transportation food chain on its head, with cars demoted from their place as the dominant species and instead treated as guests.

However, boroughs added a few cycling lanes, tried to stop rat-running, and just like that, people are terrified of a world with fewer cars.

Drivers are arguing about parking spaces and demand full access to every square inch of asphalt. What is your endgame? Fewer transport choices for people? More cars on the road? Increased congestion? Higher pollution? What are you actually trying to achieve?

So what are the arguments?

It's not good for people who have to drive (e.g disabled people): As a disabled person who must drive, you are wasting countless hours in traffic because of the many people using their cars for convenience and comfort.

It blocks emergency services: I'm still waiting to read a report from a reliable source. Do you have a link to a study demonstrating cycling lanes reduced emergency response time by x%? Otherwise, it’s just he said, she said. From where I stand, cars are blocking emergency services. If you were in your car when you could have easily walked, cycled, or take public transports, YOU are delaying the ambulance on its way to save a life. YOU are the problem.

It's fine the way it is: Hundreds of studies have found correlations between traffic emissions and diseases such as asthma, heart and lung ailments, cancer, and more.

People WANT to drive. They don't HAVE to drive. They want to keep doing whatever they are doing. How is your convenience above everybody's health?

Edit: Disability isn't the subject of the conversation. I'm pointing out that many people use it as an excuse for driving in London when they are young and healthy getting in the way of the very people they claim to defend. Yes, some people are taking their cars once a month to the countryside. That's not the reason London is gridlocked every weekday around 9am and 6pm.

The outer circle around Regent’s Park has *no* zebra crossings - even though it bisects London Zoo and is the only way to enter the park.

Not even just in London but all over. Just seemed like it clicked and suddenly I started noticing cars where ever they could fit and how ugly it is.\n\nEven looking at the space given to them. If you look at building to building its like 80% of the space is for cars, lanes each way and then both sides are lined with parked cars. Then outside of London(and many places in London) they're even parked up on the pavement most of the time. Where I live now its normal for them to mount about 75% of the pavement width leaving such small space that a double buggy or wheelchair can't get by. Like they already have 75% of the road width and with the pavement parking it's over 90%. How entitled to then complain about a few parking spaces being removed, especially when in Central London most journeys are done by people walking despite only having a small amount of pedestrian space. \n\nAnnoying part is a lot of the time they're doing nothing. Like roads in London will be lined with cars on both sides and the cars just sit there all day doing nothing, sometimes all week. I think it's found that cars are parked 95% of the time. So all that space dying to be used by 100,000s each day is instead being used for someone's parked car.\n\nThen onto the parked car thing its crazy how valuable space is in London but we're okay with giving massive amounts of it away for someone to essentially store their private property 24/7. Would be like me propping up a shed on the side of the road outside for free. It sometimes seems worth buying a large rusty old van and just parking it outside on the street all year for a massive amount of free storage space.\n\nI get that they're needed for some, especially certain contractors, but so many journeys aren't needed. I'm on mobile so I'm not finding the document but TFL said it's something like 30% of London car journeys are less than a mile and 50% less than 2 miles. A mile is like 18 mins walking or 5 mins on a bike!.\n\nI think we should greatly expand the amount of bus lanes and maybe make buses free, it's only like £150 per Londoner per year for them to be free I think.\n\nThings will slowly change for London though. So many developments going up now have little to no parking. Like 3,000 home developments having spaces for just 7% of the homes. All new office buildings going up have bike parking for 10-17% of workers, there are now already many with 1,000 spaces. Several boroughs are now dropping under 39% of homes having a car. Even the santander bike scheme now makes a profit, one of the few parts of tfl that does. \n\nAnd yes cars are the number 1 slow down of emergency services, that's proven too but gets no attention. Could probably split cars being used and cars parked up into 2 categories and they'd take up the first and second spot."", ""I've got a car, I don't drive but for my wife go to work commuting takes almost 2 hours, one bus, two trains.

I've done it, but when you have things to do, the car is far more convenient.  \n\n\\&gt; What are you actually trying to achieve?\n\nHonestly, just more time with people I care about, versus sitting on the tube/bus by myself"", 'I just came back from the Netherlands and the sheer volume of \n• Electric wheelchairs using cycle lanes\n• Parents and childminders cycling back 5-6 kids in one cart(!)\n• elderly people and children cycling without helmets because they don’t need to wear them to be safe.\n\nIt made me so sad and jealous. London isn’t that big, so many more journeys could be made by means other than a car if we stopped giving all our roads to them.', ""I bet there's no need for 75% of cars here, given we have such a comprehensive public transport system compared to other cities. There is certainly no need for so many cars around schools, it's ridiculous"", 'Public transport should be revived', 'Loved it when XR closed down Oxford circus. Was genuinely so much more pleasant, and the air was less toxic which is good!', 'I just remember cycling round London during the first lockdown and it was amazing. It was super quiet and gave me the best opportunity to cycle around and take photos of normally very heavy touristy places (like Covent Garden).', 'I’m in Zone 6, completely agree with you. \n\nWe walk or use buses where we can for local journeys, when as a family we’re travelling light. It’s usually quicker and cheaper than fuel and parking. We also use online food shopping. \n\nHowever some journeys towards zone 2 or 3, or the other side, are an absolute pain by public transport and it’s far quicker and comfortable by car. My commute to work, 10 miles further outside London, is double the time and quite expensive by public transport. It’s also a pain to go anywhere else in the UK - beauty spots, family, holidays. We love going to Whipsnade Zoo, difficult by public transport even with direct links. For holidays, thought about hiring a car for two weeks, costs really add up quickly with car hire to the point it makes no sense. \n\nCars give us freedom, there’s more to life than Zone 1.', 'Honestly I never knew the extent to which pollution is ruining the air in London; until I moved here for uni. I’m from Wiltshire in the countryside, and I swear I’ve had more eczema flare ups in the past year that I’ve been in London than I ever had before; hell, I never even knew I had eczema before because I hardly ever got flare ups. It’s pretty scary really, and I’m glad that I can go back home for a pollution detox - I really don’t know why anyone would want to drive in London anyway…', 'London is good for car regulations.. way harder to drive a car round here then in say Barcelona, so our air quality is also significantly better.

I’m hoping the ULEZ extension will help reduce the number of vehicles, but it seems like more of a poverty tax as newer cars are pretty much all excerpt and most people visiting will still pay for a day of whatever. It just hurts the people who have cars but can’t afford a newer one.', 'I’d love to see a new London where the size of your car wasn’t the way people expressed how well off they were. Maybe one day.', 'I love cars and modifying them but i could not fathom why you would own (especially a sports or tuned) car in an urban area.', ""If anywhere should be a city that promotes walking, cycling/scooters and public transport, it should be London. There is more than enough connections wherever you go there, and enough room for cycle lanes to be used.\n\nEnfield now has the infrastructure in place, (well on Hertford road)\n\nRight now it does get rammed with so many cars going into less space, but as people transition to walking/cycling, it will be a massive difference \n\nTired of seeing every other car being a big bulky SUV or mini SUV taking up road space, unecessary cars to have when they're not really traveling far on average"", 'When I hear people who drive complain about all the traffic I say “you’re not in traffic, you ARE traffic!” And honestly they get so pissed hahaha', '[deleted]', 'And here I am in North America thinking how not-car oriented London is :(', ""Cars are ruining London, that cannot be denied. Their infrastructure consumes a lot of space and looks putrid – I mean, would you want to live next to the Hammersmith Flyover? They add noise and air pollution, and contribute to the poor health, low quality of life and death of citizens. \n\nBut, at least the powers-that-be are tackling it head-on. We can't suddenly take cars off the road overnight. The backlash against low traffic neighbourhoods was because they tried to do just that – they were too sudden and disruptive. Right idea, wrong execution. But they are just one more small step on the way to weaning the city off its dependency on private motor vehicles.\n\nBy the end of this decade, I suspect we will see far fewer petrol-powered private motor vehicles on the streets of London, and by 2040 I would be surprised if there was anything left except for shared electric vehicles.\n\nThe trick is to be patient. Everyone knows cars are bad for London… but you have ever tried to tell a heavy smoker they need to quit?"", 'We need to ban them from more areas. They really do fuck up the city', 'I just got back from Spain where the towns and cities have so many pedestrian friendly walk ways in them with trees and benches, it was so refreshing and I enjoyed walking so much, also sitting at cafes was quieter without cars whizzing by constantly. It feels like they prioritize the experience over the convenience of cars. \n\nReally stood out to me coming back to a London. Barely a street or cafe without a  busy street right outside.', 'The government agrees; that’s why the congestion charge zone and low emission zones exist as well as insanely low speed limits. Kn addition to mitigating  the environmental impact, it’s clearly intended to deter people from driving. \n\nThere’s a time and place for cars (Not the obnoxious loud ones. Stop compensating - a loud car isn’t going to make up for your tiny penis or your deep seated feelings of inadequacy), but for most able bodied people, central London is not the place, at any time. Same holds true for most parts of inner London. \n\nI empathize with people who live in areas with less access to transit and more open space, especially those with children. I can see cars making sense. But I think London, especially in the more built up areas, needs a lot more pedestrian only areas.', ""I'm absolutely with you here. I feel like there is some overlap with how council's are developing boroughs as well, both in terms of commercial and residential space. I really do believe in outer London we are giga-fucked because of that fact that neither council's or private landlords want to develop spaces that will better residents' quality of life. I'll give you a very specific example of what I mean: I've lived in South East London my whole life (apart from the years where I was studying at university) and I have seen Greenwich town centre change throughout that time. There's so much development happening around that area, especially in Deptford. Greenwich town centre is full of pubs (although it always has been) and, more recently, expensive coffee shops like Grind coffee have opened. The thing with town centres like this is, these shops have to be somewhere and having a couple of coffee shops isn't too bad, but what does offer the local communities who live, quite literally, round the corner? Even in my very local area, a greengrocer was meant to be opening a shop on a nearby parade of shops but was outbid on renting the unit by a takeaway pizza business. Good luck to pizza business but it's not like we needed another one! It would be lovely if people who owned this space thought more about what would benefit communities rather than who they can make the most money in rent from.\n\nMy point being: London needs to become a place where we have everything someone needs within a 15-20 minute walk away. If you live in central London, this is almost definitely the case. But in outer London, this is so sorely needed. We have become swamped by out of town retail parks that attract people with bigger shops and free parking. Improve the cycling infrastructure and make it easy for people to access the businesses they need. It requires vision and strong-willed local politicians to push through the policies but it can be done."", 'You should have seen a recent AskUK thread on the highway code, it descended into some serious cyclist bashing.\n\nUntil infastructure and perceptions change there will continue to be vast numbers of cars in London that spend most of the time sitting in traffic blaming everyone else.\n\nJust yesterday someone looked to purposely squeeze me off the road on my bike and the sad thing is you just get used to it. You are a vulnerable road user and they are in a metal box.', 'The problem with London is its a major idiot magnet\n\nWhen these idiots have money they buy loud cars to drive around at 10 mph', ""It ruins London because the other options are not great. I used to commute to London, and I'd rather take my care because it was quicker, and was cheaper. If it was quicker, cheaper and worked then I'm sure people would leave the car at home. But it's not.

lmkh48,[deleted],t3_lmkh48,I've developed a free public toilet locating app,2021.0,2.0,18.0,"Hi r/london !

I'm the developer and founder of **Toilets4London - a free and open source public toilet locating app** for London. I am using datasets sent in by councils and community groups as well as data scraped from council websites. My aim is to make this the most up to date source of info on where to find publicly accessible toilets in London. I am committed to updating the app and keeping it free and transparent. There are also features to report inaccurate data and rate toilets.

The app is being actively **supported by the Greater London Authority** after I won the Mayor's Entrepreneur Smart Cities Award with the idea, and beyond the app itself, after lockdown I hope to lead a city wide campaign encouraging more businesses to sign up to community toilet schemes.

The app is available for both **iOS and Android** and you can find links to download at [https://www.toilets4london.com/](https://www.toilets4london.com/) .

For those that are concerned, the app has no ads, does not collect any user data, uses minimal memory space on your phone and I try my best to optimise for accessibility (if you have problems using the app due to any kind of impairment, please let me know and I will try to adapt.)

If you have any app feedback, issues or ideas, **feel free to contact me**. You'll find a contact form on the website or you can use the app to send me an email. Also please note that although I try to do whatever possible to keep data up to date and accurate, at the moment councils are not great at keeping track of their public toilets and effectively sharing open data which means that there may be some inaccuracies. Please rest assured that I am trying my best to improve this situation but everything takes time : )

EDIT:

Thank you everyone for the support and suggestions!

Jesus Christ.', 'Its all fun and games til you realise those properties are being sold to bigger rental companies that lease it out as an airbnb.\n\nAverage people are still priced out of the market.', ""Is it too much to ask that 'professional' landlords understand the cyclical nature of market forces?\n\nIf landlords aren't making as much money as they want from their rental properties due to the pandemic, then why not draw on their reserves to see them through a period of market turbulence? Or extend their borrowing? Or renegotiate their financing? Or accept a lower rate of return? Look for opportunities to cut costs elsewhere? That's what normal businesses do for normal assets.\n\nAnd there's always an option to dispose of underperforming assets that cause *so* much financial stress for landlords - this is covered in the article."", 'I’m one of those foreign-born that left the studio I was renting in Feb 2020. The landlord asked me to come back to the property because they couldn’t find someone else in those crazy pandemic times and they didn’t want to lose money...

When her tenant left in February 2020, she dropped the rent from £2,150 to £1,600 a month and still took two months to find a replacement. “It was incredibly stressful,” says Cooper.\n\nlol 1600 a month.', ""Yeah, nah I'd rather have an individual I can speak to own the place I'm renting rather than some faceless bureaucratic company that'll have a standardised non-negotiable lease and arse me about by definition over everything."", ""I moved last week after finding this place on Zoopla.  It had been on the market since July 2020 and the landlord/estate agent had reduced the price from almost £1800 down to £1400... I managed to negotiate getting this large 2 bed apartment for £1200 by reminding them about how much money they'll lose and that they're still paying for the upkeep of the property even though it's been vacant for 6 months.\n\nDon't be afraid to haggle especially if you see that the property has been on the market for a long time.  Zoopla shows you the listing price history so use that to your advantage!"", 'It\'s ridiculous when landlords say ""oh I don\'t make much money each month, after the mortgage and taxes"", or in this case, think they\'re actually losing money. No, someone else is paying your mortgage. You are always accumulating wealth either way. Expecting your liquid assets to also increase at the same time is just trying to have your cake and eat it.\n\nOh and it\'s stressful? Well, jobs tend to be like that. Too many don\'t think of it that way, just as something they do on the side that shouldn\'t take up any of their time or effort.', ""Feels like you're missing the actual outcome of the story, unless you prefer 'proffesional' landlords to people who own one or two.

I’ve not understood why anyone is meant to give a shit that property is not a risk free investment. \n\nI own and rent out a flat in London, at a loss. I don’t go bitching and moaning to the FT.\n\nI bought the place because I love it and love the area. My wife and I lived there for a while but to move for work for a bit so we figured we’d rent it out. It’s better than leaving it empty. We can’t wait to be back. \n\nTenants complain no more than I would for an issue. When one decided to move and we needed new folks, sure it took time but was hardly “incredibly stressful”.\n\nI don’t expect the government to treat me different tax wise.

It was hilarious how they tried to put in our contract a clause that basically said you've received 'a special discount which we fully expect to not be the case next year, and the rent will go back to normal market value'.\n\nApart from the stupidity of them to put something in our 1 year contract which has no bearing on this year and doesn't mean anything/require any action... Is the fact they classed the rent we're paying now as a 'special discount'. No. If people won't pay the old price anymore, as people always knew it was overpriced, then that is no longer market value. The new price is.\n\nMorons.\n\nSeems like they're all still in such denial about the exodus from London.\nI did look into potentially being a landlord and renting out, but I did the maths and very quickly realised it was never going to make money. One boiler breakdown and you've essentially lost 6 months of profit. It's just not worth it. Which highlighted to me how those being landlords are only those that got very low mortgage payments/have none at all. These old farts are the ones that got mortgages for like £400 a month, unlike now the £1,500 a month it costs"", ""So, I can understand the sentiment, but I fear that all smaller landlords would be forced to sell up to the bigger ones while big ones can afford to sit this out. I don't think much changes just monopolies increasing even more."", 'I was renting a flat from Blackrock.

Couldn't imagine being in central London (especially during the summer when the suburbs seemed even busier!) during this.\n\nOn a side note, my one major complaint of private landlords is this expectation of a risk free, free money return.

nqn6i7,punkbons,t3_nqn6i7,warning: be careful taking mdma this summer,2021.0,6.0,2.0,"me and my friend and gf took crystal mdma last night. we took one line. i had been told by someone that none of the batches in London are good or even safe at the moment. I’m not sure why we did it but we all feel extremely bad about the whole situation.

Basically my mate had to be hospitalised because she said she was struggling to breathe and both of the people i was with violently vomited for about an hour after taking it. I only vomited once but the people I was with were in a bad state. We’ve got mixed opinions on what it was, some people think it was heroin or a downer, some people think meth and I wonder if it’s a research chemical. 

I think it was just a bad trip and we’re all physically stable and fine, but I’m honestly begging anyone who takes MD in London to be really careful at the moment. Make sure you test your stuff. It could’ve saved us a terrible night. I’m sending it to be tested now. But honestly a lot of the MD around right now is really dangerous. We didn’t take pills for this reason but I’m almost certain that most of it is unsafe right now and it could’ve been so much worse had we taken more or been younger. 

I don’t even know if this is the right place for this but I’d really like to warn everyone about this. It worries me that it could’ve been worse and I just want to inform as many people as I can. Have a wonderful day, I’m gonna have some lucozade and a kebab and try to feel less awful about this whole mess.

EDIT: Thank you for all the awards and kind messages. I’m overwhelmed that some of you are so lovely. Those of you being not so kind, please try and remember that you don’t know the whole backstory to this situation. We are all very shaken by the whole thing, we are aware we fucked up. We are now just trying to build ourselves up the best we can. Please don’t be dicks to someone who’s basically still a mentally ill teenager and on an awful comedown. We are trying to recover.

q9ib4o,JGLING101,t3_q9ib4o,Missing Person - Help Please!,2021.0,10.0,16.0,"Hi everyone,

My cousin has been missing since last week Saturday morning, having been last seen by a close friend of his last Friday up until midnight. As of writing this, it has been 8 days since we’ve heard from him.

He lives in his own room in Islington, sharing the building with others who have rented a room there. None of his friends or housemates were made aware of any plans he may have had to leave for a period of time, what’s even more strange is that he left without his rucksack, wallet or laptop. His food is still in the fridge and the only things missing from his room are his coat and trainers.

We have tried ringing his phone, both last Saturday and Sunday the phone rang but he never picked up or called back. Since Monday his phone has been switched off.

My cousin is an adult, aged 30 but always stays in contact with us over the week, often calling his mother to check in every other day. He is not one to leave mysteriously and not get in touch with anyone. The fact that he has been missing for this long and hasn’t been in touch is extremely concerning, especially since his phone has remained switched off. He does not have any criminal history nor has he ever been involved in criminal activity. He does not take any medication nor did he recently express any mental health concerns to us or any of his friends, including the close friend he was with last Friday night. We believe that he is not currently in any intimate relationship.

I have already filed a missing person’s report with the Metropolitan Police who have said that they would be working on the matter. Nevertheless, any sort of help would be immensely appreciated.

My cousin is 175cm tall, has dark brown - medium short hair, brown eyes and is a white male of slim build. As mentioned, he is 30 years old and is, unfortunately for the potential clarity of this situation, self employed.

I have been in touch with his previous work place and exhausted his close contacts, all of which have not heard from him since last Friday night.

As far as I am aware, I am unable to post an image on here, which would of course be very helpful, but if you do believe you might be able to help, please reply to this post and we’ll go from there..

Thank you for taking the time to read this and may you all be safe.

Yasin


EDIT: Thank you so much for all your concerns and helpful input. 

I will start by providing the Met Police reference - Met Police: Your Call/Crime Ref No is CAD - 2817 -  14/10/2021.

I have never made a missing person’s report before and have looked around the Met Police website, I can’t find any dedicated page made for my cousin, the only thing we have right now is this reference. We have been told that if we have any further information, we could use this reference when calling 101.

We have searched the building he was living in to the best of our ability together with a gentleman responsible for overseeing it and haven’t found any traces of him potentially still being there. We have also tried to let the police know that a deeper search of the building might be helpful just in case.

When it comes to trying to locate his phone, I have tried to access his laptop so I could try to find anything on there that may indicate where he might have been going but I am unable to guess his pin or get through his faceid on the laptop.

I have also tried to look for CCTV cameras around and inside the building. Sadly there are no cameras in the building and the ones outside are not associated with the building. I am not sure how to go about gaining access to any recordings that may have spotted him potentially leaving the building at some point after he was last seen.

I do apologise for how unhelpful my description of his features have been.. I’ve thankfully never had to make a post like this before and wasn’t sure what else to describe other than simply attaching a photo. I’ve decided to try to attach a photo now through a link as I don’t know of any other way.. I really hope this isn’t against the rules mods, I don’t see any other way of actually showing what my cousin looks like.


[missing person post] - (https://ibb.co/LhVgKKN) 

[image taken on last day seen]- (https://ibb.co/CW7cHpT) 

As far as I am aware, the police are trying to explore ways of reaching him by tracking his usage of his bank card through TouchPay as well.

This is all I could really think of to add to the first edit after reading all of your comments. I will be doing my best to reach out to different organisations and charities that you have mentioned as well.

Thank you so much for all your concerns and helpful comments. We really hope that he will show up safe but every day that passes feels like a heavy rock pushing down on that hope..

Take care for now everyone.

There's resistance on both sides and imagined public opinion is a far bigger factor than ideology. Culture wars this ain't.                                   \n              \nYou might think it's already basically decriminalised witihn the m25, but consider: police often stop and search for knives, but find weed and *have to* respond. Take the latter out of the equation and stop and search becomes optimised to tackle violence, plus fewer instances of the criminalisation of the demographic that live in areas where stop and search is implemented - i.e. lessening what some people refer to as 'institutional racism'. These are highly desirable outcomes.                \n                   \nDecriminalisation doesn't take money out of the hands of criminals. In fact, it makes their lives easier, and possibly increases their trade. *Legalisation* is the tool which enables the state to take spending on weed away from criminals and pump it into healthcare, education, transport, etc. so legalisation is preferable in terms of big picture economics and social outcomes.                  \n                \nDecriminalisation doesn't address quality control - and this is a bigger issue that many people realise. Lots of the mental health issues connected to weed are ameleorated when users are educated about strength and strain and can choose acordingly. (Imagine wanting a nice calm after work drink, but all that is available are tequila slammers or moonshine!). You can argue that people just shouldn't use weed if it causes them problems, but take a look around - that's just not realistic.                     \n                     \nDecriminalisation has some benefits, but the benefits of legalisation are far greater and further reaching.

oz2g3l,Papaya2678,t3_oz2g3l,"Living in London, am I doing it wrong ?",2021.0,8.0,6.0,"I moved here less than a year ago ( during the pandemic ) hoping that once it will be over I would experience the famous “exciting life” London has to offer.

But since a few weeks/month I feel a bit disappointed by life here.

It’s my second job after uni so even thought I have a decent salary I feel like it’s not enough to find a decent place to live that will feel like a proper home rather that a people storage.

I just feel like I’m compromising a lot, living with strangers, in tiny flats without living rooms. But in exchange I don’t feel like it’s worth all the money wasted especially now with the WFH revolution.

Knowing that I come from a medium sized city in Southern Europe it’s also quite hard to live with strangers after 5 years comfortably living on my own. 

It feels like I had a better quality of life as a student than here working my ass off. 
Not because my parents are rich or anything  but because of housing prices.

On the other hand there’s things I love here I like London as a tourist, all the food, and diversity. I also love my new job, I met my boyfriend here and I love him. 

I’ve met quite a lot of people but struggle or make any good friends that I can see on a regular basis as the city is huge.

I know my problems are shallow... but I guess I just needed to vent, leaving is not an option as the moment.

London is still an amazing city but I just didn’t expected the housing situation, the weather, the prices and the lack of community to really drain me.

Plus everyone around me seems to love life here so I’m wondering if I’m might be the one doing things wrong ?

Apologies for any grammar mistakes or typos ...

EDIT : I absolutely didn’t expected to get that many comments so thanks a lot to every person who took the time to answer.

To give you more details I’m not fully hating my experience in London and thinking of moving back  just not hating some aspects. I also feel the idea of living here is overrated compared to reality.

To the people who said that flats were the problem :

I had a terrible first flat-sharing experience here, living with strangers with absolutely  no communication between us not even “hi”. 
They were gross and we were just sharing the same space during lockdown but that’s it. I was counting days before the end of my contract.

Now I’m flat hunting again, I don’t mind living with people though I prefer to be on my own it’s just that the housing market is absolutely ridiculous and it’s quite hard to find something decent/affordable but also not too far from my central.


Anyway Iike many the cultural shift brought by WFH /the pandemic and all the uncertainty around it made me think about what I was getting out all the compromises It takes to live in London.

But despite that I will stay here a few more months/ years to at least develop my career so any tips on how to settle in is welcome :)",926.0,0.91,611.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"['&gt; But since a few weeks/month I feel a bit disappointed by life here.\n\n\nI mean... You moved to an exciting ""get out there and do it"" city in the middle of a pandemic.

Most of that is missing at the moment, so I definitely sympathise with you. It\'s like you\'re getting all the downsides with very few of the upsides.', ""For me personally I found prioritising living with cool people made all the difference. Yeah I might live in a tiny cupboard and I've gone from having a massive flat of my own to sharing with five people but actually having some kind of friendship group I could just move into and join has made London massively fun for me.

London is such an expensive city to live in, you need money to live that exciting life all the time.\n\nLots of people compromise on where &amp; how they live to be near to cool and exciting neighbourhoods, but it still requires lots of money to be out every night for drinks or dinner or other cultural/social things to make up for those living situations. So yes, you almost certainly would have a better living situation in any other small European city!\n\nIt's also tiring! It's a big city. Making the most of it means travelling all over, sometimes for over an hour at a time, which can be hard to motivate yourself to do after working all day.\n\nI think this is just the reality of big city life - either you have the time and energy and money to go all in, or you're always going to feel like you're missing out on something.\n\nI've lived in London my whole life, but these days live much more of a village kind of life, in my part of the city. I rarely go central but have loads of hobbies and things I enjoy doing locally, within 15-20 minutes of home.

Joining some local Facebook groups also helps for that! Plus you don’t get so tired from too much travelling. Maybe you should consider moving flat/a new area possibly; again echoing others there are definitely affordable and nice flat/house shares available in the right areas with living rooms. I’m a big fan of South East London which I think is also very affordable and so much to do (having also lived North of the river for a couple of years beforehand). Check out the South East London Housemate Co-op group on Facebook! Plenty of nice groups of people and houses/flats in some great areas', 'London has poor quality of life overall unless you are wealthy. If you come here from abroad you need to understand why you are moving. If it’s for career, then you suffer for those 5-7 years until you get what you wanted out of it.\nIf it’s for everything else, I believe there are better cities to land. I come from Southern Europe as well and have shared the same “shock” at housing quality, poverty, mental health issues etc especially as I’ve lived in a decent amount of cities, including NYC etc. London is just another level of messy on this front in my opinion. It’s also what makes it an interesting city but it’s also very hard on a person.\n\nYou are not doing London “wrong”, you need to understand your intent of being here. \n\nIn my case, I am here due to my company but will leave in 2 years. I became asthmatic since the move due to pollution &amp; generally I find the quality of living to be poor (mostly due to housing). There are some amazing things about London, but those can also be tapped into every few months, especially if you have ability to work remotely etc.\nI considered settling here fulltime (buy a place) but with costs of childcare and everything, the math simply didn’t work out at the quality of life level.\n\nBig cities are great but can be extremely painful if you are on a tight budget. As an EU citizen also remember that you have so many cities to choose from in Europe so there is no need to feel stuck as we still have the privilege to shift to a city that has a bit more room to breathe.\n\nFigure out your goals and it will be easier to manage it here and find the right balance. ✌️\n\nGood luck!', 'I can totally get this, despite being a very long term Londoner. London is a slow city to get into, not the most friendly at all and a tough nut to crack! \nThis will have been taken to a new level given the Covid recovery and a summer, where frankly, the weather has been very shit. So the usual summer vibes of the city have not really been there. \nGreat that you met a lovely bf. \nCan only suggest building your networks gradually - work friends and non-work and my friends from overseas have eventually loved living in the city. \nThe accommodation part is tricky and sharing without the upside of a shared and social ‘living room’ is not great. The balance of income and cost is a big reason why some people decide it isn’t worth it - and particularly when the city isn’t ‘buzzing’ at the usual level', 'This is not exclusive of London.\n\nThat\'s just big city living. It feels like a dream to go there, visit and imagine yourself living a fun and glamorous life with a bunch of new exciting friends. When I was younger and visiting London on a regular basis, I would imagine leaving work and just go out and have drinks with friends in all the cool boroughs on a regular basis.\n\nThe reality, however, is that London is huge, you have to work your ass off to be able to live nearby and enjoy the cool stuff that central London has and it\'s a struggle to actually meet with anyone.\n\nThing is, you need to have your expectations aligned with your reality. If you\'re not making enough money, it will always be a struggle to enjoy the city as you imagined. Chances are, you will have to live with strangers for the next years or compromise to live outside London, pay less for housing but take forever to actually get to London.\n\nLondon is and will always be expensive. That\'s the ""entry fee"" of living in one of the most visited cities on earth.', 'This is one of the main reasons I left London.\n\nThe reality is that quality of life is not good in London. It’s crazy expensive, it’s crowded, it’s too big, and you end up with very little free time as a result.\n\nI live in a smaller european city now and I can go out *walking* to meet friends in 10 minutes instead of spending 40 minutes on the tube each way. Allows for a lot more serendipitous interactions and new friendships. \n\nI have a beautiful flat to myself with a nice terrace instead of some shitty tiny flat. I can go out and have food/drinks without feeling guilty for spending so much money after.\n\nNone of that is possible in London unless you are rich.\n\nLondon is good for starting a career. It’s good for pursuing interests in arts, politics etc. But as a place to live, it sucks balls. IMO people only love it if they are originally from some small town and don’t know any better.', ""I think London is still far far from its normal self despite now having no restrictions. Its much much quieter, events are more scarce, and the 'vibe' isn't what it usually is, partly from covid and partly from the crap weather we have been having. It's been an especially grim summer.\n\nI moved here 2 years ago and think things feel flat at the moment compared to pre covid, it's hustle and bustle and spontaneity hasn't returned yet, but I think by Christmas this year we will see things slowly returning to the 'buzz'  that you expect with tourists picking up and a lot of return to the office, albeit it not quite as before."", ""As a young person in the same leaky boat.

I am not on a great salary, but the experience I'm getting working in London is second to none. \n\nSo I make do with the cramped apartment and the loneliness and the cost of everything from coffee to public toilets. Because long term I'll be better off because of it. \n\nIf you are in London just because you want to be in London, and now you no longer want to be in London. Leave. You don't have to stay here, if you'll be better off mentally and financially somewhere else, go there. \n\nIf you are in London because your job is in London, but you're working from home all the time. Leave. You probably won't be able to live abroad because of taxes and shit. But you can live in Swansea or smt and enjoy a much better standard of living than in London. \n\nOtherwise, slog it out until you find a job somewhere else, or find a partner with which to buy a house either in London or somewhere else."", 'Corporate landlords is what kills and has always killed the quality of life London could otherwise offer. \nI was reading they had the exact same shortage of properties and rents issues back in 1700. \n\nI would suggest charging astronomical taxes to corporate landlords with more than two properties as a possible step towards a solution.', 'It’s not even shallow. I think a lot of people can agree and feel what you’re going through. Housing here is a joke! You pay an exorbitant amount of rent to basically get a small box studio flat to yourself. To get a decent flat you need to pay upwards to £1100 A MONTH which is ridiculous.', ""I love it here but it's because it's much more fun and interesting than anywhere else in the UK, you're comparing it to back home so it'll be different. \n\nI enjoy exploring the city, even by myself, there's always something to new to do and see, even after 5 years. But building and maintaining relationships is a lot harder. The city is too big and people are too caught up in their own lives for such communities to establish. Its a great place to be while you're young and energetic but now I'm at a stage where I need my own place too, rather than live in a house share."", 'One thing that helped me a lot as a fellow EU immigrant was to join a sports club. I see my teammates 2-3 times a week and they’ve become some of my best friends here. It makes the city feel much more like home to have a group of people you see very regularly outside of work. \n\nOther than that sharing flats is annoying by try to move in with friends. I recently moved in with 3 friends and now it’s actually a lot of fun - I’d rather live here with my 3 friends than have an apartment by myself, just for the social aspect. It’s like night and day compared to living with total strangers! You have to fund a way to make flatsharing work for you (for me personally that was 1) choosing a nice location &amp; a nice house overall, compromising a bit on room size and price and 2) living with friends as opposed to random people).\n\nAnyway I’d say also try and go out and make the most of London. You have access to one of the top cities in the world in terms of entertainment, history and culture. If you’re not doing much in the city, it’s not worth the premium you pay in price compared to your hometown I reckon.', 'Someone said this before and I think is pretty accurate:\n\nCheap, Central, Nice, pick 2 of these 3 criteria, but not all 3.\n\nLondon is fun, but it is expensive, and you can only really enjoy all the fun it offers if you can afford things. Some people can go cheap on accomodation or food etc in order to have money for other fun stuff, but seeing from your post, you want everything: nice place to live in, good living and still have all the fun. You **CAN**, but it will cost you.', ""London is great for a weekend break, or as a tourist, or if you are wealthy.\nYou pay a fortune to just survive here.\nAs an example, here in London I pay the same in rent for a week (for a small 2 bedroom flat) as I paid for a mortgage per month for a lovely big house up in the north west.\nLiving here you also become more aware of the seedier side.

psp9mc,Dapper_Monroe,t3_psp9mc,The Vincent Van Gogh exhibits are categorically NOT WORTH IT!,2021.0,9.0,21.0,"Oh boy. I made a post about this last week asking if anyone has been. I went in with an open mind expecting it to be a great way to see Van Gogh's work and take some snaps. 

Well I went. And it's a gigantic rip off. I can't quite believe they charge £25 per person for this. I'd pay maybe £5-£10 for entry but £25? Crazy overpriced and underwhelming. 

I went to Van Gogh Alive (the one in Kensington) which is supposedly meant to be the bigger of the two (the one in Shoreditch is just a single room in a warehouse). 

Well, it's bigger but not by much. It too is just a single room of projectors and random Vincent Van Gogh quotes (which were frankly, depressing as hell).

All I've taken away from this experience is that he was a deeply mentally ill man who had no idea what was wrong with him because psychology wasn't as advanced back then and had zero help. A beautiful artist who had no idea that his misery was in fact the thing inspiring him to paint so elegantly. The poor guy was clearly deeply unhappy, confused, poor and neglected. And yet here we are cheapening it. 

In terms of it being a day out for the family, don't bother. It's small. It's underwhelming. There's a bunch of people sitting on the floor watching the projectors and then as soon as Starry Night is shown before it loops after about 4 minutes, they all make their way for the exit and repeat. 

There's also a tiny room with fake sunflowers in it people were actually queuing to go stand in. Actually queuing to go stand in a room with fake sunflowers they've purchased from Wilko. 

That's it. 

In my experience London always lives up to expectations. There are many places that seem like cash grabs which actually end up being pretty decent. Yeah not this place. Do not waste your money on this unless you're a massive fan of Vincent Van Gogh and prepared to pay £2.00 for a can of coke you can buy at Tesco for 85p and £15 for a poster that you could print in ASDA yourself for about £3. Oh and of course randomly sit on the hard floor with a bunch of other people watching screens for 4 minutes on a loop.

I was heading home on the Northern Line after a few drinks after work, and saw a 20-something girl at the end of my carriage, clearly in some distress.

She shook her head and said she wasn’t. I sat down on one of those fold down seats next to her and asked (quietly) if it was “physical or personal”. It was physical. Long story short, turned out she had appendicitis, was in absolute agony and was trying to get to High Barnet so her dad could pick her up to go to the hospital. I sat with her until her stop, and tried to crack some jokes to take her mind off it (apparently laughing made the pain infinitely worse so I packed that in fairly quickly). She managed to reach her dad, and we somehow managed to get her up the stairs @ HB, and into her dad’s car who sped off out of the car park. Didn’t hear from her for three days after I checked on her via FB (she’d given me her name).

I thought it was very nice of her to check on me though.', ""Anytime I have seen this happen, it's been a woman crying which creates a difficult situation for me in my head. On the one hand, I desperately want to offer some actual practical help or at least an ear. But I feel like a 40 yr old guy randomly approaching a crying woman also gives off serious creepy vibes to most people, including (most importantly) to the person crying.

But not like I would expect that from anyone as I know it can be awkward.', 'Once I have the lady some tissues, she was thankful and smiled. That was enough for her at the time as she stopped crying. The second lady I told her whatever she’s going through will come to pass, she was pretty inconsolable so we got off the train together and I stayed with her a few mins to make sure she was ok. She seemed shocked that I cared, perked up, gave me and hug then we both went our separate ways to work that morning. I’ve noticed people tend to either stare or pretend they can’t see it. It’s really disheartening the lack of compassion people have for fellow human beings. Just a moment of kindness can change so much. Please if you see such, try and show some compassion. Some people have nobody to lean on and the smallest gesture speaks volumes.', 'Studied abroad in London 2 years back and only one time bawled my eyes out over a guy.

This is probably due to the more widely available charging infrastructure than there is for the electrolysis and transportation/storage of hydrogen fuel. There are only 20 Wright StreetDeck FCEVs in London.\n\nHowever TfL are investing in both hydrogen and battery electric towards achieving a goal of a fully zero emissions fleet. Many routes in London are already run only using battery electric buses. These include (but are not limited to) the C1, C3, C10, 507, 521, 23 43, 46, 70, 94, 134, 98, 108, 312, H98, 200\n\nAs we can see, battery electric buses are much more popular and Alexander Dennis and Optare have made the right choice by investing heavily on battery electric technology.

njwe7b,IskanderMinger,t3_njwe7b,"I made a website to help answer ""where to live in London"" questions",2021.0,5.0,24.0,"(Mods: this is a personal project and not something commercial so I figured posting it here would be OK, but please let me know if this isn't the case!)

So I made a small web app to help property renters/buyers find the right London area to live in based on their criteria: [https://findmyarea.co.uk](https://findmyarea.co.uk/)

Basically you pop in the stuff you care about (budget, commute destinations, local amenities etc) and it’ll give you a list of areas (e.g. Hackney or Richmond) that satisfy your requirements. It’ll also show you a detailed breakdown of how each area measures up with respect to your criteria.

Anyway, let me know what you think! (btw the design isn’t great -- I’m a data scientist, not a web developer ;-))

Some things you might notice:

* Commute times are more “indicative” than accurate -- they’re not horrendous, but I didn’t want to pay for the really good stuff :-P Plus the areas themselves are big enough that the commute time is always going to be within a range, not a specific number.
* What I consider to be “in” an area is sometimes a bit generous, although I have an upcoming fix for this
* Some of the criteria work better than others... e.g. to make the “schools” criterion work well you really need to estimate catchment areas, and I haven’t yet had time to do this
* At the moment specifying a property budget and commute is compulsory -- in reality there’s no reason for this to be the case. But I figure few people are infinitely wealthy hermits.

**EDIT:** Wow, thanks a lot for all the feedback! I'm blown away by the amount of interest in this -- I'd only showed it to a few friends so far and I was expecting maybe 10 more people to use it after my post here. In reality it's 5,000 unique visitors and counting since yesterday, which is hilariously far from what I thought would happen.

Anyway, it's great to hear that it already works quite well for a fair few people. I'm noting down all the comments and will work on sorting out the various issues that have cropped up -- luckily most of them are fairly easy fixes.

I’m used to be a big proponent of them and them being legalised for private use, but there’s just too many bellends riding them on sidewalks.

Case in point, this morning, took my puppy for a walk in Victoria Park and was coming back over the bridge on Old Ford Road, with not great visibility, due to a building on the edge and a narrow path with a concrete fence on one and a metal one on the other side, just enough for 2 people to walk by easily.
One person was coming towards me, so I made space to easily pass each other when a bellend comes right around the corner on a scooter on the sidewalk accelerating. Had to pull the puppy to the side really fast, otherwise the cunt would have hit me and the puppy, causing a lot of injuries considering to all of us considering the metal fence with bars.

pfpnjy,EveAndTheSnake,t3_pfpnjy,Stop. Feeding. The. Pigeons. For God’s sake PLEASE.,2021.0,9.0,1.0,"Help. My parents’ neighbor will not stop feeding the pigeons. 

Three times a day he pours some kind of seed/grain all over the ground in his garden. The pigeons wait, gathering outside my bedroom window and on the houses of surrounding neighbors. They wake me up in the mornings as they wait. They poop all over our houses and gardens. All the neighbors hate it.

Ever since he started feeding them, my parents have been having rat problems as well. I have a pigeon stick that I bang against my window as I scream at the pigeons, occasionally making eye contact with the neighbor, but its effects are short lasting. We’ve begged him to stop but they are his “hobby” and he’s named them all. No one has reported it as I believe he’s perfectly entitled to feed rats and pigeons on his property. 

Any suggestions? Spikes won’t work because we’d have to plaster every surface of the neighborhood. This has been going on for a few years so by now the pigeon gang is large, established and bold.

If you're working in London and currently on £10.85/hour, look to see if your workplace or contract mentions the London Living Wage or Living Wage Foundation, if it does, push for the new wage of £11.05/hour. (note, technically the employers have 6 months to increase the wage and not lose LWF accreditation but you can absolutely push for it sooner rather than later.)

If you're on less than £10.85/hour chat to your colleagues about demanding a liveable wages, you weren't being paid enough by 2021 standards and the cost of living has gone up a lot this year, 2022 will be even tougher.

Prof. Smith was a British theoretical evolutionary biologist and geneticist and he tended not to follow rules, in fact he was quite mischievous if truth be told. He passed away in 2004 but he was very interested in sex (shocker eh? British man interested in sex!)\n\nConventional wisdom states that in nature it’s the most beautiful peacock that gets the bird – or hen in peacocks case, and it’s the biggest silverback gorilla that gets to pass on his good genes and it’s the strongest, fittest stag that gets to mate with his herd and this seems logical.  \n\nI’m sure we have all watched nature programs about baying stags fighting over who gets to mate but there is a problem with this theory, namely that after a few generations all male progeny would be strong, fit (and most likely related and therefore cause issues with interbreeding) and logically it should erode genetic variance in the population, it’s called the Lek Paradox.\n\nHowever, Professor Smith liked to turn conventional wisdom on it’s head and this is where sneaky fuckers comes in. He took DNA samples from herds of wild deer in Scotland and studied their mating habits during the rutting season and rather surprisingly the DNA seemed to have a very wide spread, it wasn’t just from the strongest/fittest deer but also from many of the less fit deer as well. \n\nAnd then he observed something interesting. As the largest male deer squared up to each other and clashed horns (or antlers in this case) most of the females got bored  (excuse the pun) and sneaked off into the nearly woods where the other deers were waiting and they mated with them. And with typical aplomb Prof. Smith called these deer Sneaky Fuckers because that’s exactly what they were doing, sneaking off and mating with the lesser deer hiding in the woods and increasing the genetic diversity.\n\nSo there's a life lesson guys"", 'What the FUCK is that in the top right-hand-side of the picture?', 'Fenton would not have allowed this to happen', 'I can still remember when BBC2 would always feature stuff like lions mating at 6pm/ teatime.', '[deleted]', ""Hope Fenton doesn't suddenly run in"", 'FENTONNNNN!!!!!!', 'They doing the good deed?

I am trying to drink less and lose a few lockdown pounds, but it looks like my only option now is going for a long walk just like the last 1.5 years =/

If you\'re ""socially solitary"" (meaning single and some combination of new to London, a natural introvert, or in a period of enforced social distancing), London can be a surprisingly hard city in which to find interesting things to do that don\'t involve eating or drinking, especially if you\'re on a budget.  Yes, there are a lot of cool free/cheap museums and cemeteries, but I find these to be more of a once-per-month activity.  It\'s hard to be excited about your n+1st museum that you\'ve seen this month alone, especially if you\'ve got no one with whom to discuss the interesting things you saw.  \n\nIn the end, the answer always seems to come back to walking around London, going somewhere else (even more expensive and difficult now!), or trying to synthesize yourself into some social group, but I can say I have lived in a lot of cities on a lot of continents and London is the most cliquish city I have ever experienced. So, it\'s hard.   \n\nWhen I first arrived in London, I walked hundreds of miles to explore and entertain myself, but, like you, I hit a point where I just didn\'t want to walk anymore.  I had walked all the streets within a three-mile radius of my flat so many times that to walk to somewhere new I almost needed to take the Tube, which sort of defeats the point.  I started looking for tasks to take me to some more distant place in Zone 5 or 6 and I would walk back to my flat in Zone 1 from there.  Those were good, memorable days that had a nice combination of accomplishment and exploration, but there\'s only so many tasks you can find to give you reason to travel from Zone 1 to more remotes parts of London.  \n\nI joined the Tate as a member for a couple of years which wasn\'t cheap but I found very rewarding.  I never get tired of taking the boat between the two Tates and I also value spontaneity--being able to see special exhibits any time I wanted was worth a lot to me.  Unfortunately, I think Covid has killed what\'s left of the non-booking-and-queueing part of London life.  Boats are still fun though.  \n\nIn the summers, I started doing things outdoors that you normally associate with mundane indoor tasks.  I would take my laptop to the park and use my phone as a hotspot and answer boring emails but do so in nice weather.  Or just read a book.  Sometimes I fed the ducks at parks which I found surprisingly soul-restorative.  \n\nOne summer, I moved all my stuff into storage and stayed week-to-week in different parts London.  That was exhausting but fascinating!  London, being the amalgamation of little villages, is perfectly suited for that--every part of the metro area has a unique history and nature.  I really enjoyed getting a (figurative) taste of each.  I think this might be logistically impossible now in the Covid era though.  \n\nAnyway, I\'m empathetic to your issue.  My best advice is to find a curiosity that gets you out of the flat, maybe taking a language class, researching family records, taking a skills course (like a sport or CPR/First Aid), learning about the architecture of the city, just anything where you\'re curious, you will be in for mentally stimulating, low-calorie entertainment and not the usual ""dressed up pirates mix you cocktails"" fare.', 'Live music.

Hire pedalos and go to the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park, walk past Buckingham palace through to Green Park and St James’ park, peek in at the giraffes in Regent’s Park. There are so many gorgeous areas to explore that differ greatly from each other - from the brutalist Barbican to prim and pretty Primrose Hill. So many interesting people have lived in London through the years, have a look for their blue plaques! If you Google you can also find articles on historic places that can only be found when looked for. Today I walked around Holland Park and Notting Hill, the other day I went out to see Richmond. Both trips (minus travel costs, but the underground is v cheap) completely free.

pmoo4v,Appropriate_Law_1627,t3_pmoo4v,Am I going crazy? Or is London...,2021.0,9.0,12.0,"Am I going crazy? Or is London quickly becoming one of the WORST UK cities to live in, unless your salary starts at £50k+

I’ve lived here now for 37 years, moved into my first flat in Enfield in 1984. When I got to North London, there was crime, there was poverty, but there was still something to live for! There was still happiness and prosperity! Crime rarely boiled above the surface and poverty was siphoned to the best of its ability by the local community. My biggest issue back then was racism! 

Almost 40 years on, living now in West London, I can see how drastic a change London has been through. It’s so bloody hard to describe but let me give it a go. 

Before London was a typical capital city, expensive, up itself, and a tiny bit ahead of other cities. A bit like today yes. But it was mostly inclusive in non Westminster areas and filled with character. Teenagers mostly would keep to themselves, go to chicken shops, play out but only a few would slip through the net and cause trouble. 

Now London is just a breeding ground for cultural an classist disparity, every year we see the gap between the rich and working class increase. The tories have cut youth spending by god knows how much, so areas like Harringey, Lewisham, Lambeth, Newham, Harrow and Tower Hamlets to name a few, are filled with rotting abandoned youth clubs. These areas surprisingly see the highest numbers of youth crime and unemployment...

Most youth leaders I knew back in the 90s and early 2000s have either left the city or have just gone into teaching. Some have gone back to crime. 

I won’t even get started on the housing issue, the fact so many people are stuck in the abyss that is not wanting to rent anymore but not having the means or savings to pay for a house because renting is so expensive. When everyday we see new modern apartments being built in the middle of communities that once screamed for better housing accessibility. 

Living in London feels like a compromise. In exchange for your sanity and wallet, you’ll get pretty mews, skyscrapers and cool neighbourhoods to gorge into. However year by year in this compromise you’ll begin to see that it’s not a compromise, its a trap!",621.0,0.82,536.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"[""Trocardero. Whyyyyy did they take you awaaaaaay from us!?

Renting out a room instead of a flat has become the new normal. Depressing to say the least!', 'I find the complaints about public transport in London very bizarre. Yes, it can be annoying to commute from one end of the city to the other, but that’s how it is in most major cities. The business districts are almost never residential. Traffic is only really crazy at the peak times (hence why they are… peak times…) and TfL is so reliable and consistent that it almost doesn’t matter. In uni I was constantly visiting Brum, Manchester and Liverpool for work and love life, and the public transport was pits compared to London. \n\nAlso, it’s been mentioned already in this thread, but London is very clean compared to other major cities (NYC especially). TBH, I think that these places should be our point of comparison, rather than a U.K. city that has nowhere near the job market/cultural offerings/opportunities. AND, if we’re then comparing to places like NYC, Brooklyn is just as far from Zone 1 as Zone 5, if not further, and it’s a lot more expensive. \n\nNot to be harsh, but there’s a reason that a lot of smaller cities and towns in the U.K. are filled with retirees.

Crime does exist for sure, I think the last couple years may be slightly worse but there's peaks and troughs in everything, it's generally trending down.\n\nI've also lived in a very nice part of London quite comfortably on £30k a year, people make out like its way more than it is. If you choose to live in Central London and have your own place sure it's expensive, but if you are also expecting to live in one of the best cities in the world, in the centre, on a low salary, that's fairly naive IMO.

I just won the lottery for Hamilton on TodayTix and got two tickets for £10 each, but just as I got happy that I won, I realized that I would not be able to attend the show as I am working that day (and partly due to the travelling chaos caused by Covid).

People who have moved here to work often seem to speak of London or its neighbourhoods as if they’d be better without the communities already established there.

There seems to be a general disdain for existing communities (across the board) that manifests itself in various ways.

qkzii7,Breakwinz,t3_qkzii7,Why are nights out in London so inconvenient?,2021.0,11.0,2.0,"You go on a night out anywhere else (outside of uk), its easy to get home, theres transport, theres loads of take-away food places open. Clubs/bars shut VERY LATE. 

Everytime I go out in London I have an amazing time up until about 2am, all places shut, theres no good late night food, its all just a shitty mcdonalds, transport at night is HORRIBLE considering the sheer amount of people in central trying to get home. Uber prices get ridiculous at night. 

Whats the reason? I seriously am baffled, go anywhere else and the experience is miles better. Dont get me wrong, I LOVE living in London, but having a late night out is just freaking hassle",538.0,0.86,268.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"[""Clubs, and everything else, shutting down at 2am is due to licensing conditions which are heavily influenced by the Met. They've been on an anti-late night thing for going on a few decades now (I remember reading complaints back when Ken Livingston was Mayor). Lack of late night food is due to that plus the sheer expense of running a business in London (High priced stuff won't attract late night punters, low priced stuff won't pay the bills) plus the lack of density (Everything is more spread out so not enough customers). Current transport issues might just be due to the pandemic. Uber and a couple others seem to be operating in permanent surge/gouge mode at the moment."", 'Having moved from Ireland (not Dublin), the transport options in London are absolutely amazing. Strong disagree.', 'Clubs shut at 2?\n\n\n\nWhen did that happen?', 'I often go to gigs that end at six? Sure the night-tube isn’t running, but that’s due to COVID. It will partly be resumed from the 27th anyway.  \n\nSorry but you’re mistaken in thinking London clubs close early.  Village underground closes at 6, The Cause closes at 6, Phonox closes at 4, Electric Brixton closes at 6, studio 338 closes at 6. The list goes on.  What clubs have you been to?', '&gt;You go on a night out anywhere else (outside of uk), its easy to get home, theres transport, theres loads of take-away food places open. Clubs/bars shut VERY LATE.\n\nThis is a terrible take. Lots of places are open until 6am. Transport is much better than most european cities.. You are comparing it with the utopia of being on holidays somewhere that you can just walk 5 minutes back to your hotel.', ""I agree the on the getting home part, but London isn't like any other UK city. It is essentially a bunch of small towns, all with their own nightlife which varies a lot from place to place, the next comparable place would be Manchester which has nightclubs in basically the city centre only.  In London, you will find plenty of clubs open past 2am in zone 2 areas like Brixton or Hackney, which do tend to largely be attended by people who live relatively nearby I think. The 2am cap is only really Central London, where no one really lives. \n\nWhen the night tube returns transport will become easier for sure but overall,  TFL night transport is far better than most public transport across other UK cities at 2am.  Uber is very expensive though and is much cheaper in Northern cities."", ""Can't agree with you. As a country bumpkin I am still thrilled with how easy it is to do late night stuff all over the city."", ""The transport bit is specific to the underfunded TfL and the Uber pricing like it's a captive market. While those two get sorted out, can you end for midnight and the last trains?"", 'What awful clubs are you going to that shut at 2am?', 'Where are you going out? There are loads of places open until 6am', 'Every other city in the UK is barely 2 miles across and nowhere near as populated, is the answer to your getting home question.\n\nIn my three years at uni in Leicester, I never once caught a bus because the furthest I could ever get from my house was a half hour stumble.', ""I've met people from other parts of the UK who say that unless you've got a mate who can give you a lift, busses are infrequent or non existent past a certain point, and your only real options for getting home are either a cab or walking. I've been on nights out in places on the outskirts of London, as well as places further afield, and unless the distance is walkable, everyone has to arrange cabs.\n\nWhile the lack of night tube is a real problem (from a safety perspective especially) and I've had to pay out for Ubers more frequently than ever, it is possible to get home on the night bus. It's not particularly nice, and especially sucks if you're caught on the other side of the city, but before Uber was a thing, it was just standard procedure to get the night bus. Again, it does suck in terms of safety - I'm a guy, but there have been several occasions where I've felt unsafe on the night bus - not so much travelling in central London, but when I've been out in Romford/Essex and caught the bus back in, it always felt like something was going to kick off at the station or on the bus itself. I can't imagine how bad it must be for women to put up with that shit.\n\nNow, in terms of places closing early, I think it's just knowing the right places to go. Some do open until 3am or later, but it depends what you're looking for. Not many pubs/bars are open super late, but there's club nights which go on well on into the early hours.\n\nEDIT: I misread part of your post. When I've been on nights out abroad, I've found it relatively easy to get around, but that's because the hotels/airbnbs I've stayed at in cities have been in a decent location. Only times I've had to use public transport in the early hours when abroad has been in Amsterdam/Utrecht, and Berlin. Both are actually really easy, and the fact that the trains between cities run all night in The Netherlands (at least between Utrecht and Amsterdam) is great."", 'Just get the night bus you flannel', 'I’m wondering what transport you think is available outside of London that isn’t available inside of London.  You live in the only city in the UK with an extensive underground network, and a massive bus network. I appreciate much of this is not available at 0300, but that’s that same in say Newcastle or Manchester. To get home you need a taxi. Why is London different/worse?', ""Where have you lived where it's easy to get home? I've only found that to be the case if you live in the centre of a city or town. For example I can't get home late night from a major city to a nearby town without a massive taxi fare whereas in London I can get trains up to 12 pm, night buses throughout the night and all sorts of taxi options.\n\nAnd this is to highlight the issue; in cities or towns the 'night life' is all centred in a smaller location and so you get good clubs, food and transport in the same place. Whereas London is more of a region and so its harder (cost and time wise) to get from one part to another late at night.\n\nLets say you lived in Walsall but wanted to go out in Birmingham (a distance of 10 miles which is probably the equivalent of living in one of the outer zones) the last train is at 11.20 on a Friday or there are two buses which go before 1 am, otherwise you need to get a cab. But London has far more options than that.\n\nWhere I grew up if you wanted a late night in the next town 5 miles away you either need to get the last bus at 9pm(!) or it's a £30 taxi home, which in your 20s is extortionate! Whereas in London I can get a nightbus or tube for a couple of quid, and I didn't live in the middle of nowhere, just an ordinary market town."", 'If you live in South London outside of zone 3 then night buses are awful.', 'Sounds like you still don’t know London well enough and it also very much depends on where you live. Night buses are really underrated, you can literally get anywhere no matter the time.', 'London is an epic late night city. I can WALK home (sure its 40mins but still!) from the places I hang out. In fact I left the club at 2:45am last Friday and got an ESCOOTER home for a total cost of £3.50', 'Central London is like that for club/bar licensing. Certainly not the case outside of zone 1 tho. \n\nTransport is particularly bad at the moment due to Uber shortage and no night tube, but it return to normal soon.', 'You don’t even have to finish at 2am to see a hige lack of offer for hospitality around.

Works every time', ""I'm a native Londoner who's been going on nights out in the city for nearly 18 years now. London nightlife is crap and it's only gotten worse over time. It's not even just crap compared to major continental cities like Berlin or Madrid, it's crap compared to small, regional UK cities.\n\nWhen you go out in those places there tends to be lots of places open late, all close to each other, many free to enter. Plenty of places that have music and a dance floor but aren't proper clubs so you can just sit and talk if you want to. When you leave there's food options open and although not many places have night buses there are cheap taxis to take you home.\n\nIn London most stuff is shut by 12pm, bars and food options alike. You're only option after that is usually a night club with paid entry, aggressive bouncers and expensive drinks. What's more these clubs are massively spread out, and I know each neighbourhood has the odd bar open until 3 or 4 but these are also spread out across the city and hard to find if you don't live in the area. It's no substitute for having a busy central nightlife district with lots of late night options for food, dancing or just a quiet drink. London totally lacks this which seems mad to me considering the size of the city and the youthfulness of its population.\n\nPeople give plenty of explanations for this; licensing restrictions, the attitude of the Met, high costs for small businesses etc. and I suspect it's a mix of all of these things.\n\nThe two explanations that I don't accept are these:\n\n1. 'It's too cold and dark in the UK to have good nightlife!' Yet Paris, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Berlin (and let's not forget Newcastle) have the same or worse climate as London and manage having a late night culture just fine. Hell, Moscow and Montreal have a more 24 hour culture than London and they are frozen solid in the winter.\n\n2. 'The city is too big and spread out to have lots of nightlife in the centre, everyone lives too far from there!' Yes we are spread out, but hundreds of thousands of people already head into the centre at 6pm to drink and dine, they're already there on an evening, the problem is we shut everything and kick them back to the suburbs at midnight.\n\nSorry to rant but I'm a natural night owl and it's the thing that depresses and confuses me most about this city, even more than the cost of living, grime and crime, all of which I could tolerate quite happily of we were more 24 hour!"", ""It's because most people (just like you) don't want to work at night. That means Ubers are expensive and public transport is limited. I'm really not  sure what answer you expected to this? I would also challenge your first sentence by the way.

They make almost no noise until they're right behind or going past you. All it takes is one idiot to lose control and you could get a nasty injury.

myus7d,MortyXY,t3_myus7d,St. Pancras Leg Injury Scam?,2021.0,4.0,26.0,"I was in St. Pancras yesterday afternoon waiting for a train. I spent the whole day travelling from Europe and arrived early at the station so I was quite tired and hungry.

I went to the ATM to take some cash and right afterwards this random guy approaches me. I tried to ignore him but he placed himself infront of me claiming: ""I'm not homeless, don't worry"".

The man suddenly shows me a really convincing gruesome and bleeding injury in his leg, like a chunk of meat came out of his leg. He claimed to be from Czech Republic and that he was going to (if I understood correctly) Brighton to visit a University. He also proceeded to ask me for £10 so he could have enough money to purchase a train ticket that was set to leave in 15 minutes. Also requested my contact and bank details so that he could eventually return the money back.

The whole situation seemed very surreal to me and evidently my initial reaction was to ask him why the hell is he not seeking/calling for first aid, screw the train help yourself first. But he insisted that he needed to get on the train.

At this point the whole situation seemed sketchy to me. How can this guy who is travelling from abroad have no money to even buy a train ticket to visit his University. Also, I'm pretty sure there are no trains in St. Pancras to Brighton (unless I understood the place wrong). Any reasonable human being wouldn't hop on a train with an injury like that.

Important to mention that 10 minutes earlier, I gave a couple quid to a kind guy that helped me navigate through the Tube so I didn't feel like give money again, especially since travel to the UK for a student is expensive nowadays due to the COVID restrictions (spent over €300 on plane, train and tests).

I told the guy to help himself first, call his University for help or seek someone else at the station because I was not going to be the person that will help him. There were plenty of other people on the station but he kept insisting me, the tourist looking person with the suitcase.

""Sorry mate, I don't want to be mean but I will not be the person that will help you right now. I've been travelling since 5am, I just helped someone else and I'm hungry, please seek someone else asap"" I said while walking away. He stood there looking at me with a abandoned puppy look on his face without even trying asking someone else or anything at all.

Looking back, I'm pretty sure this was 100% a scam due to a lot of inconsistencies in his story, especially during these COVID times. 

To the random Czech guy in question: if the whole situation was actually real (doubt), I'm sorry but you picked the wrong hungry tourist at the wrong time.

I bought a sandwich at Greggs afterwards, it was shit.

Not ""wearing old clothes to look homeless rough"" but actually legitimately falling apart. Whether the story was true he seemed to genuinely want to get out of there and get to Klaipeda to people he knew. \n\nSo I walked with him to the station, had a nice chat along the way about how he was American but stuck in Europe because of passport issues. I even asked if he wanted me to buy him a (more expensive) coach ticket instead (the coaches there are amazing, TV in the seat back, loads of space to recline and sleep) but he turned that down and said it\'s too expensive. \n\nI went in and bought him a ticket (it was £3-4 as far as I can remember) he even gave me his name and email to keep in touch/pay me back later. And we parted ways. \n\nWhen I got back to the UK I googled his name and email:\n\nHe was telling me half truths all along! Who would have thought it. He was a fugitive from America who had family in Lithuania, stranded in Europe because he would have gone to prison in the US. He was arrested in Lithuania for other more serious scams and likely came by his injuries from scamming the wrong person. \n\nTLDR: I knew I was being scammed but chose to help because the underlying issue of fear seemed to be real and the cost was negligible.', ""The worst effect of these scams is the distrust it creates, and when someone is in fact in dire need they are ignored.\n\nI was scammed once (out of only £5 but I was studying at the time and I had nothing).

After a while he recognised me and knew that I wasn't going to be taken in by it.\n\nThe point of the scam is how viscerally shocking it is. Asking for money, saying you're hungry doesn't illicit the sense of shock and urgency that a horrible injury does.

This is going to be a long shot, no idea if this kind of post is allowed but I moved to London about 2 weeks ago, and for context, I have epilepsy.

I had a seizure on Baker Street and in the process gave myself a bit of a beating through it, got taken to University College London Hospital where I was treated and let go by roughly 18:30 on Thursday 8th September. I stepped out of the hospital by A&amp;E opposite Euston Square and almost immediately had another seizure, only this time someone stole my phone mid-seizure.

Spoken to police who haven't been very helpful and the hospital staff say they saw somebody take off but didn't know they had my phone and were more concerned about my health (understandably).

If we think back to the 90s how much did we spend on mental health then, how many practitioners per person I would wager a lot lot less than now. \n\nI think it’s way way more complicated than simply an accounting problem (I.e. throw more money at it) I think the roots of it really lie in de-industrialisation which has ripped the hearts out of working class communities and removed the dignity of Labour that many working class men in particular used to enjoy. Mix that with the ease of getting prescription and non prescription drugs and you have a pretty clear path to a mental health crisis.\n\nI don’t think any amount of counselling sessions can replace the sense of usefulness, pride and financial well-being that used to come with well paying mainly union jobs in industries that have long since offshores to China. This is why you see the same exact phenomenon in parts of de-industrialised America such as Michigan with the opioid crisis.\n\nBasically we have a mental health problem because since the 1980s we have told a huge group of mostly working class men that the skills they have and the jobs they work are irrelevant and we’d rather offshore it', 'The issue is that all mental health services are underfunded or have been systematically closed down over the last decade. This is the result of that, and in particular is leading to a ballooning homeless population. \n\nMeanwhile police services are also underfunded and calling them in a dangerous situation is pointless. I called the police because a mentally ill person was brandishing a kitchen knife at people outside a coffee shop in central London demanding money and their phones - the person on the phone said they had lots of real emergencies to attend so the police never even showed up. A passer by took the knife from the man himself (which was a terrible idea). \n\nIf put in a position with someone and despite best efforts to be polite it turns dangerous the key thing is always distance.

I would go as far as to say that most people in Britain are suffering from at least some sort of mild mental health issue - and the people who were already on the edge of something much more serious are now these people you're seeing in London.\n\nSo we can increase the funding for mental health services as much as we like, but it won't stop people becoming mentally ill in the first place. As long as we're working 50+ hours a week, living in a box with no community support around us, and being asked to care about a war on one continent and an earthquake on another while discerning which source of news is lying to us today - people will keep getting unwell.\n\nAll these r/publicfreakout videos of Americans screaming at eachother over inane nonsense?

Thanks. 

-----------------------------------

Yes, it's hard, it sucks, it's depressing. It is something we all _have_ to do if you want to see this virus go. Everyone knows the deal, too many think they're the exception but no one is. However, staying home is hard so maybe I can help at least one or two people with some incentives. I'll try to give links to some things that can help cure the boredom, and some support if you need it. 

Most of this might be obvious to some, some might not even have internet and of course, money is a big issue, so I'll try to give some suggestions:

For streaming and on demand things such as Netflix et al, don't forget you can subscribe for _free_ for your first month. This goes for most things in the list. If you are worried about putting in your payment details and forgetting to cancel a month later, don't worry! You can sign up and **immediately cancel** and you still get your free month!

-----------------------------------

For people who **don't** have a smart TV, you can buy a cheap Amazon Fire TV stick or a Roku box. The Fire stick can go as low as £20 often for 1080p. It will drop to £30 for 4k. 

I picked up a 4k Roku device for £18 on Amazon once. It's fast and snappy. _currently_ it's going for £33 for the 4k version. Having both, there is little difference between the devices. NowTV also do their own roku powered device.

Subscription based streaming sites that all offer 2-4 weeks **free** for first timers

- [Netflix](https://netflix.com) *According to comments the second month is free. 

- [Amazon Prime](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/) You can either get Amazon video on its own, or take prime with other benefits. I strongly urge those who use Amazon for buying off their store front to use [https://smile.amazon.co.uk/] as there is literally no difference except everything you buy **amazon donates to a charity of your choice.** 

- [Now TV](https://www.nowtv.com) (I believe it's 7 days)

- [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/)

- [Britbox](https://www.britbox.co.uk/)

- Amazon channels. I believe you can get all these individually but Amazon offers them as channels bound to your prime account, and they are again either free for a couple weeks (again, take them, cancel instantly) or **very cheap.** I recently subscribed to **Starzplay for £1 for 3 months**. It has some good shows on it like Fringe, doom patrol. It also has channels like **Curiosity stream** and **shudder**

_If you have not subscribed to the any of the above, you can get a few months of free TV by signing up and cancelling instantly. I suggest waiting at least 5 minutes just to let it go through the system._ 

**Some tips for Now TV**. IF you already have a subscription, I've noticed you can get it cheaper by cancelling. When you cancel they will beg you to stay. Select ""I can not afford it this month"" and they should beg again, telling you what shows they have. If you say you _still_ want to cancel, they'll beg one last time and offer you the subscription for cheaper. This won't work _every_ month, but I've noticed they'll always offer it the first time, then again after a couple months. If you're subscribed to both films and entertainment do the most expensive one as it may not work both times (but it might!). You can also pick up passes from storefronts a lot cheaper sometimes, before I could pick one up on Amazon for £3 but, they seem to have cracked down on it. If you shop around (or if anyone knows of a legitimate store please let me know) you might be able to pick it up cheaper. Lastly, check their website and under your account they should have an ""offers for you"" section. 

-----------------------------------

**Completely free TV**

- [Pluto TV](https://pluto.tv/live-tv/)

- [Viki](https://www.viki.com/)

- [Roku](https://www.roku.com/en-gb/)

If you do have a smart TV and/or device, there are some good free streaming apps. One I really love is called **PlutoTV**. I know this is on both Roku and the fire stick, as well as Ps4/Ps5 and xbox.

Pluto offers a bunch of live channels and now an on demand section, all for free. It has adverts but they are actually short (shorter than regular TV and fewer of them). Some of the channels are just streaming certain shows like Mythbusters 24/7 or Dog the bounty hunter, but it has a lot of old movie channels as well as 24/7 kickboxing and MMA. It also has a 24/7 poker channel I quite like.  

Another one I like is **Rakuten Viki** however, I haven't watched it for a while as my fire stick is only 1080p and I have too many other devices attached. I believe it is on Roku but you have to jump through some hoops and have an account. The last I checked on the fire stick you did not. Viki offers a metric ton of _Asian_ shows, mainly from Japan and South Korea but it does have chinese, Malaysian etc. It has subtitles. Some Japanese shows are hysterical, albeit weird. 

Roku also do their own channels with free shows if you own a device. 

For those who **don't** have a smart TV or a Streaming device, you can set up your own computer as a dedicated streaming device with [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/). It's been a while since I used it but I believe it now also offers free movies and TV. 

-----------------------------------

**Anime**

If you are into **Anime** there is 

- [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/en-gb)

- [Funimation](https://www.funimation.com/)

- [HiDive](https://www.hidive.com/)

The first 2 are free to watch, or offer premium without ads which you can have a trial with. Crunchyroll is the better of the two with more original choice for Japanese voice and subs, while Funimation has more Dubs. I don't believe HiDive is free to watch but you do get a 2 week trial. These are more exclusives than the previous two.

-----------------------------------

**PC Centric software** 

**If you are a gamer** or like **Audiobooks** or **anything that uses computers for things like music making, programming or graphic design**

- [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) 

- [Fanatical](https://www.fanatical.com/en/)

- [IndieGala](https://www.indiegala.com/)

**Humble Bundle** offers, as per the name, bundles. A long running site that got bought out by IGN. It offers both single items and bundles you can buy individually/as a pack while also offering a separate monthly subscription for around £8-9. The subscription gives you 12 games on average per month. That's the simplest explanation but it changes somewhat as sometimes you get to pick 10 out of 14 games, or get all 12. 

Humble bundle offers more than just games though. Every Tuesday they bring a new bundle of games, while Thursday (I ""think) a new bundle of books. They very often have books from the Black Library giving you a ton of **Warhammer** books. Sometimes it's standard **E-books**, other times it's **audiobooks**. A few times a year they do bundles for graphic design, a typical bundle would include programs like **Paintshop Pro** Corel Painter etc, They usually go for £0.76 for tier 1 up to around £18 for tier 3, which would include 4-6 full titles with 10+ addons. They also often have **Music making bundles** or **video editing software** as well as **Programming** or **video game development**. 

The bundles change often, they usually have around 11 bundles at a time that last for 20 days. Sometimes it's trash but they do often have some _very_ good deals. 

**Fanatical** offers the same as humble bundle except usually not as high quality, but sometimes they do have some incredible deals, and they are very very cheap. 

Both humble and fanatical are safe, trusted and been around a long time, and they are **NOT** grey market key sites. They work _with_ the publishers and developers. You can buy games both old and new for a lot cheaper than you would most other places. Unless it states otherwise, keys are usually for steam. 

**BOTH HB and Fanatical (HB much more common) offer free games fairly often. The catch is linking your steam account to them (at least HB). It is safe however. 

**IndieGala** is another site like above. Except, these are much much lower quality. However, they offer a metric ton of free games. Quality is low but it is legitimate, and a lot of free stuff. 

-----------------------------------

**Game Store Fronts**

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) This one is so obvious I didn't add it, but apparently many want me to. It is the best out there, and you can find almost everything, with fantastic deals. 

- [Greenmangaming](https://www.greenmangaming.com/) offers games cheaply. Again, _not_ a grey market site (which are legal but unethical) and they sometimes do bundles. 

- [GoG](https://www.gog.com/) (Good old games) is a DRM free site run by CDPR, the makers of the Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk. They offer you games quite cheap and not needing DRM (such as Steam, Uplay etc which is less invasive versions of dodgy DRM from the olden days). 

- [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/) Despite the controversy whether you care about their rivalry with valve, they offer **free** games ever week. Without ever having bought anything I have gained over 170 games. literally. Good games for the most part. They often give you £10 coupons as well.

- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) Everyone knows twitch, but if you don't, it's a streaming service for watching gamers and girls with low cut tops accidentally bending over in front of the game. However, if you're signed up to prime, you get free games each month (and randomly between the set bunch). 

- [Playstation Store](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/latest) Currently has January sales. Currently the free games for PS+ are for PS4: **Shadow of the Tomb Raider** and **Greedfall**. For the Ps5 it is **Maneater**

- [Games with Gold](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/gold) **Bleed 2** and the **King of Fighters XIII** is available until Janurary 15th whilst **little Nightmares** is available until January 31st. 

-----------------------------------

**Gaming Subscriptions**

Like the TV versions, you can sign up to these for a **free** trial (or very cheap). If you do sign up to only one at a time, it should keep you busy for a few months

- [Xbox Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass) You can do this on both/either an Xbox or **PC**. If you sign up to the regular one, you can get a month (maybe three!) for £1. After you have done that, you can sign up to the premium version for 3 months at £1 a month. Most people know game pass, but you can download a large selection of games for free. The premium version gives you games with gold, allowing you to keep the games forever (but can only play with a subscription)

- [Ubisoft+](https://store.ubi.com/uk/ubisoftplus) I'm not 100% sure if you get a trial or not. This allows a large collection of Ubisoft titles to play for £12.99 a month. Quite expensive but good if you like Ubisoft titles I guess. 

- [EA Play](https://www.ea.com/ea-play) EA's version. Goes by a ton of names I think, EA Access, EA Play, Origin Access etc etc. There's a couple of versions of this, and it is across all platforms (PS4/5, Xbox, PC) but not sure about the switch. I ""think"" the premium allows you to play on all platforms, while the cheaper one on a single platform, but I may be mistaken. 

- [PS Now](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps-now/ps-now-games/) a once terrible service that is now actually very good. Allows you to download some Ps4 games to your PS4/5 and lets you stream a massive amount of Ps2/3/4 to your PC or playstation. 

There's more like nvidia's service but you need the Shield device which is quite expensive. I'll leave it at that. 


-----------------------------------

**Audiobooks &amp; Ebooks**

- [Audible](https://www.audible.co.uk/) Not sure what the current deal is but if you are a prime member you can sign up for a trial and get a **free** Audiobook each month for 3 months. Some warhammer books are 48 hours long, 3 of those gives you a good 100+ hours of listening!

- [Comixology](https://www.comixology.co.uk/) Another Amazon company, but lets you download some free comics I believe. 

- [Marvel Unlimited](https://www.marvel.com/unlimited) No experience with this. /u/ItFuckingWont wanted me to add it. A subscription service for Marvel. 

-----------------------------------

**Education**

- **Sign Language** [BSL here](https://www.british-sign.co.uk/learn-online-british-sign-language-course/) No experience myself, suggested by /u/n21brown and asked for a few times. Didn't know SL was so popular! Listed as ""Pay what you can""

- **BBC's Bitesize** [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize) is apparently good for home learning. Again, no personal experience.  

-----------------------------------

**If you need some spare change**

Okay, I don't generally bother with it, but maybe some of this could be useful to you. **These are NOT a quick way to make a fortune. These are small things you can do over time for a bit of pocket change**

- If you have **prime** you can get a **FREE FIVE POUND GIFT CARD** by literally just streaming a song from Amazon music (which is included in prime) [here is the details](https://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17727399031) **According to the comments it's only for select people, but it's worth trying** If the link doesn't work for you just google ""Amazon £5 coupon music""

- Now, these sorts of sites have been around for years, I haven't used any other than [talkInsights](https://www.talkinsights.com/) which I must have signed up to 10-15 years ago. Basically they send you surveys and you answer them. They are confidential and don't ask for personal details in the survey. You need 2000 points and you get £20. During the pandemic they've slowed down but I probably get around £40 a year. Not much I know, but it's an email followed by a quick survey ticking boxes. Depending on your answer sometimes you get screened out, I'm not telling you to lie but just be consistent with your answers and you should be able to work out how to not get screened. Some emails are only worth 20 points, others 200. It's slow to get to the 2000 but very quick to just answer a few questions. 

- Apparently r/beermoneyuk is a good sub to make some pocket change with. 

- There is also **matched betting**. I have never done this, I don't have the patience but from what I've read, it's legitimate, it works and you can make a fair amount of cash from it so long as you do it correctly, and there's a ton of guides. I mention this because people stuck at home could get into it and as long as you're careful (I.E not entering in the wrong numbers) it's risk free AND it pisses off the betting shops. It seems people in comments have had success with it. **Disclaimer** A couple have complained about gambling. This _arguably_ is not gambling. If you are susceptible to addiction do not do it. However, it's argued that there is no fun or buzz in this, and it's a very tedious and time consuming thing. Others argue you can't make the same money anymore (People were making thousands, now only hundreds if that). It's _risk free_ providing you know what you're doing, the risks are user error, such as entering the wrong numbers. Someone pointed out that due to the lockdown, bets could potentially be cancelled due to sport stopping. So use on a side of caution. We're (mainly) adults so I'll leave it up just because this doesn't have the excitement of regular gambling. 

- **Microsoft Rewards** This is an easy way to make pocket change doing very little. Most people have a MS account. [The rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/rewards) program offers you numerous ways to grab points, by playing free to play games, answering small questions (you don't even need to answer most of the time, just open the link and shut it) and by using bing and searching on it. I've gotten 20k points JUST by answering questions over a couple months. There are many rewards but you can grab a £5 gift card for 6k for example, or a month of game pass (and AFAIK you can make points playing the games)

- **Google rewards** Someone mentioned [this](https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/) in the comments. I have not used it, so can not give any input on it. Sounds similar to TalkInsights which I linked. Google states ""Complete short surveys while standing in line, or waiting for a subway. Get rewarded with Google Play or PayPal credit for each one you complete. Topics include everything from opinion polls, to hotel reviews, to merchant satisfaction surveys. We’ll notify you when a survey is waiting.""

That's it for now. I will try to update as I go along. A long post but I hope that it can help some of you with finding something good to do that's free, cheap or a bargain. I do suggest getting prime, especially since you get free music, free delivery, free TV and music and free video games each month. In fact, there's a ton of perks and I feel I've gotten way over the cost investment. 

Hope it helps someone at least

/u/PartTimeCrazy said if you bought an **Apple** product you get **3 free months of Apple Arcade and Apple TV free for a year**

**HEALTH**

I'm not a doctor! But if you're a smoker, something I strongly suggest is to quit. I struggled for years but in the first lockdown I quit, technically. I haven't had a cigarette since, however, I do that silly thing millennials do. I vape, but, it made quitting _extremely easy_. I would not have been able to do it if it wasn't for [88Vape](https://www.88vape.com/) They sell extremely cheap liquids at £1 each. You can find these in B&amp;M but you can pick up 25 for £20 or buy your own mix. 

Vitamin D deficiency has been said to be a big problem for the virus. I'd suggest (again, not a doctor!) that you pick some up. [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/search?query=vitamin%20d&amp;icid=tescohp_sws-1_m-sug_in-vita_ab-226-b_out-vitamin%20d) do a 3 for 2 deal. So you can pick up 270 tablets for £7. 

If you are **vulnerable** you MIGHT be able to phone tesco and get put on their delivery saver list (currently it's paused but phoning may help. At the very least they might give you a priority slot. I did this for my mum, we didn't shop at Tesco but I phoned for her, and they put her on with no hassle, so she can always get a delivery.

**HELP &amp; ADVICE**

The [lockdown](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52530518) Rules. 

Reasons to leave home include:

- Work or volunteering where it is ""unreasonable"" to work from home. This includes work in someone else's home, such as that carried out by social workers, nannies, cleaners and tradespeople

- Education, training, childcare and medical appointments and emergencies

- Exercise outdoors (limited to once a day). This includes meeting one other person from another household in an open public space to exercise

- Shopping for essentials such as food and medicine

- Communal religious worship

- Meeting your support or childcare bubble. Children can also move between separated parents
Activities related to moving house

**I want to add, if you are in danger you are also allowed (and must!) to get away from the situation** for some reason, BBC seems to have missed this very important thing (or I am blind)

- *To flee the threat of harm or violence.**

Update:

-----------------------------------

**Digital Art**

These are **Free**

- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) Arguably the best in my opinion. It has a load of options, brushes and a decent UI. It works fantastic with a tablet. 

- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) This is a decent program but last I used, the UI was a pain, and it isn't so user friendly while misses features, but it works, and it is possible to do some incredible creations on it. 

- [Medibang Paint](https://medibangpaint.com/en/) This is slightly geared towards Comics and Manga. I really enjoy using this with my drawing Tablet. As far as I know, it also for regular tablets for Android/Ipad and is free. 

You can pick up a drawing tablet on Amazon quite cheap these days! Small ones that are just a black slate such as the wacom ones are good but takes some practice to get use to, but very worth it if you can't afford a dedicated drawing tablet with a screen. 

-----------------------------------

**Office suit software**

A couple of **free** applications for word processing, spreadsheets etc. 

- **LibreOffice** [This](https://www.libreoffice.org/) has most the average user would need to write their own books or to work from home. There's not a huge amount of difference between the two I'm linking (since I last used anyway) so it's more for preference. 

- **Open Office** You can pick this up [here](https://www.openoffice.org/) and again, like above it's just preference. 

**Music Making**

It's going to get pinned for a bit. Thanks very much for your efforts,  I am sure others will find it really helpful!"", '**HOW TO LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE**\n\n**TL;DR** \\- there\'s only one truly necessary link, and it\'s at the bottom. The next couple of paragraphs are me barking at you for not believing in yourself. [JUST DO IT.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0)\n\nAnyone can learn any language. That the Finns can speak Finnish is proof of this. But especially in the UK, we have an aversion to polyglotism; perhaps because we don\'t need it as English dominates the world, but more likely because we think that learning a language is incredibly difficult, that ""I\'m not good at languages"". It\'s not true: if you weren\'t good at languages, you wouldn\'t be able to read this.\n\nIn my experience, the biggest obstacle is the method of teaching yourself. Many assume you need to attend classes, or buy four hundred hours of Rosetta Stone CDs, or actually live in France. Who would do that to themselves?\n\nInstead, take the advice of [Capt. Sir Richard Burton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton), a Victorian badass who could speak 29 languages by the time he died:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Learning foreign languages, as a child learns its own, is mostly work of pure memory, which acquires, after childhood, every artificial assistance possible. My system of learning a language in two months was purely my own invention, and thoroughly suited myself.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I  got a simple grammar and vocabulary, marked out the forms and words which I knew were absolutely necessary, and learnt them by heart by carrying them in my pocket and looking over them at spare moments during the day. I never worked for more than a quarter of an hour at a time, for after that the brain lost its freshness. After learning some three hundred words, easily done in a week, I stumbled through some easy bookwork (one of the Gospels is the most come-atable), and underlined every word that I wished to recollect, in order to read over my pencillings at least once a day. Having finished my volume, I then carefully worked up the grammar minutiae, and I then chose some other book whose subject most interested me. The neck of the language was now broken, and progress was rapid.\n\nThat is: learn the basic phrases first (hello, goodbye, thank you, my name is, two beer please, how much?, my friend will pay...etc.) just like you did in school. Then you learn the grammar of the language; how whole sentences are built, verb conjugations, tenses etc., then you learn you the vocabulary.\n\nUsing this, to learn almost any language (let\'s say French) you will need:\n\n* A \'French for tourists\' style resource, which covers stock phrases\n* English - French dictionary\n* French Grammar guide\n\nThe above is the absolute bare minimum you should consider. New copies, that\'ll be about twenty quid all told. Below are things which will help inordinately.\n\n* Flashcards (I prefer actual paper cards I can carry round in my pocket, but there are lots of flashcard apps)\n* Post it notes for sticking on things around the house with what they are in French\n* Audio resources for listening\n* Someone to speak to/with/at for speaking practice\n\nWhy do it like this and not just stock phrases? Because when you were at school you learnt to say \'my name is\' in French as \'je m\'appelle\' and repeated it and repeated it and repeated it. Here\'s the thing: The word \'name\' doesn\'t appear in \'je m\'appelle\', because French has a completely different grammar to English. Je m\'appelle translates to \'I call myself\'. You likely wouldn\'t know that if you stopped learning a language at 16, but if you learn how the grammar of a language works, you can build entire sentences from scratch - it\'s then just a matter of learning the vocabulary and replacing words in those sentences. Bonus: learn what grammar is fundamentally (verb conjugation, pronouns, prepositions etc.) and learning a second or a third language will come even easier.\n\nI recommend following Burton\'s method for the most part. Once I\'m past the basic phrases, I start studying the grammar. I pick a topic, say verb conjugations, and that\'s what I spend the next twenty minutes on. Read about verb conjugations in the grammar, make notes, see if there is anything that corresponds in some of the basic phrases I already know (""Oh, voulez vous (do you want...) is a conjugation of vouloir, great."") Put the book down, come back later and see if I can remember what I\'ve learnt. New words and phrases go on flashcards and they go in my pocket to be pulled out whenever I have a spare few minutes. Duolingo is great for this after you get past the initial first chapter or so, as it teaches by repetition, repetition, repetition. Which is great if you already know the stuff, but not so great if you\'re new to it. The key is to use several resources together to compliment each other.\n\n**Netflix** has programming in several different languages, but has subtitles in even more. Watch your normal English language programming, but put French subtitles on at the same time. You don\'t need to follow every word precisely, just spot the ones you know as they appear. Eventually your mind will start linking them to the English you hear. Experiment with watching something in English with Spanish subtitles, then in Spanish with English subtitles, then Spanish with Spanish subtitles. Remember: don\'t do it for much longer than fifteen or so minutes. You\'ll get frustrated, confused and you\'ll want to give up. Just do as long as you can be bothered and then come back when you\'re fresh.\n\n**EDIT:** this didn\'t come out quite how I envisioned it, but I think the above is a genuinely useful prompt for anyone. I\'m here all afternoon so if anyone has any questions on the process of actually learning a language, or the resources I\'ve used in the past (Spanish, German, Mandarin, Hindi) ask away. I am not fluent in anything right now, but can survive and have conversations in about five languages, and learnt enough Icelandic in three days using the above method to impress some girls, so it does work.\n\nThe only link you\'ll actually need:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/resources#wiki\\_language\\_learning\\_resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/resources#wiki_language_learning_resources)', ""I'm just so tired of sitting down but I don't want to go outside to a desolate world....   \n  \nIt's affecting my mood so much."", ""If you need food, check with your local Gurudwara, many are offering a free meal to be collected at the door, you don't have to be Sikh to be fed. \n\nFor more education with kids, twinkl has some great free resources and you can get more access for £5 ish a month. Schools are also uploading free less na for  each class, if yours isn't then scope out other schools website, maybe look at your nearest 'excellent' rated school. \n\nOxford owl also offers free e books great for primary aged kids."", 'Oh, give me half an hour(?) and I’ll write up how to get started in learning a language if you like.\n\nEdit: https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/krn0zy/lockdown_things_to_do_help_advice/giazth8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3', ""I think it's really important to exercise and stay active during all of this. This list has a whole lot of video games and television shows but doesn't give anyway for people to keep fit. \n\nWhile it's probably important to forgive yourself for gaining a bit of weight over lockdown, it's also really important for your health - both physical and possibly, more importantly, your mental health - to have regular exercise.\n\nJust some things that might help:\n\n* DDR pads are about £30 on amazon (stepmania is an open source dancing game)\n* /r/bodyweightfitness has a good recommended routine\n* lots of good yoga channels on youtube\n* a bit more expensive but you can buy a stationary bike for £200 or so\n\nAnd of course, you are allowed to leave your house for daily exercise too, so running and biking is always an option."", 'Great thread.

We followed the stream to a clearing in bottom a valley, which perfectly sheltered us from the wind and drizzle. We decided it would be the perfect spot for a den.

At a time when our lives were being turned upside down, I was incandescent with rage and completely distraught. I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/gjvl7b/porch_pirates_e17/) sign and posted the picture on Reddit and Insta that evening. The response blew us away. I cried solidly while reading all the responses; you all brightened our days on our lowest and darkest moments. For those of you who remember and might be interested, a quick update.

Born at 23+4, 17 weeks premature, our twins weighed less than 600g (1.3lb). They were given a 40% chance of survival, and only a 1 in 10 chance of being 'neurotypical' (i.e. no cerebral palsy, no severe learning difficulty, and so on.) They spent 150 days in hospital and while the journey was by no means straightforward, they have beaten all the odds. We are the exceptionally proud parents of [two of the cheeriest babies](https://imgur.com/gallery/WWZYSGO) you're likely to meet.  

Thank you again to you all for your support. To those who sent clothes, thank you and I hope you'll be happy to know that when they grew out of them, we passed them on to parents who were in a similar situation - your generosity will have cheered not just our lives but more parents down the line.

Love to you all,

J, A, B &amp; P

pr4edl,HighburyAndIslington,t3_pr4edl,Did you know there’s a “Hong Kong style” express bus route in London!? Go-Ahead London Central route X68 West Croydon - Russell Square parallels Abellio route 68 and runs in the peak hours an express with a non-stop section. Here’s a Volvo B5LH MCV EvoSeti 10.5 m double decker bus on that route!,2021.0,9.0,19.0,,413.0,0.93,61.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"[""&gt;Did you know\n\nI once accidentally got this bus rather than the normal 68, heading to Waterloo at the end of the workday. It didn't stop at Waterloo, so I ended up in West fucking Norwood with no idea where I was nor how to get home. From memory my commute that evening was closer to 2hrs than my usual 45mins.\n\nSo yes, I do know."", 'Since r/London passed r/HongKong in terms of subreddit size, I just wanted to share a bit of Hong Kong in our city!\n\nThe X68 is the only TfL bus route that is express and has a significant length of non-stop section. Hong Kong’s bus network is a complex beast, with lots of express routes that have non-stop sections, motorway running, routes that split around peak-hour, and is full of all sorts of deviations. As an example of a Hong Kong bus route, CTB’s 962 route series, which runs from Tuen Mun and the Gold Coast into the CBD, runs as 962B and 962X in the off peak, but splits into routes 962A / B /C / D / E / G / P / S, and X962 during the peak hour with various route deviations to serve different passenger flows!\n\nIn contrast, London’s bus network is a lot simpler. Routes generally run all day and have a simple pattern. Very few routes have branches, short turns or deviations. More infamously, London only has 4 bus routes that can be seen as “Limited Stop” or express. These are the X26, X68, X140, and 607.\n\nFor the X26, X140, and 607, whilst they skip some stops, they still have stops spread evenly throughout the route. However the X68 is an anomaly. Something more similar to Hong Kong’s route structure. Not only is it express, but it has this unique structure where only picks up between West Croydon and West Norwood, runs NON-STOP straight into Waterloo, before setting-down at all stops until Russell Square. \n\nA lot of Hong Kong routes have this pick up, non-stop running, then set-down structure to connect the suburbs into the city centre. London just has the X68, and it only runs in the peak hour.', 'X68 is great, used to live in West Norwood and commuted on it for a few years.

There are now arguably too few drivers for the demand.\n\nAdd to that, that Uber made recent changes to the app. The value of the trip and destination are now visible on the drivers notification that a fare is available. Previously this was hidden and the fare value was only made available after the driver had collected the passenger. \n\nWhat it has (inadvertently?) Caused is a system that encourages drivers to take first journey that comes up, UNLESS a higher value fare comes up whilst en-route. At which point they\'ll cancel the journey they were on and then get the higher value journey. \n\nAdditionally drivers have multiple phones, and are often running multiple ecosystems such as Uber and Bolt in parallel. So they can accept a journey on one phone but still be in progress with another and because the app ""can\'t see"" that there is a journey in progress you the end user are left guessing what the fuck are they doing and why are they driving away from me? \n\nBasically, Uber has made some shitty changes to the app, coupled with there being too few drivers to really meet demand means that the end user experience fucking sucks.

Went outside and hailed a cab (which holds 5/6 as standard) and all in all it came to £20 with a tip. \n\nThe previous times I have gotten an uber the drivers have taken an age to show up, have been abismal at driving, constantly looking at their phones either to see where they are going or to decline or accept new jobs, and in some cases not even been the person they say they are on the app.\n\nI rarely get ubers (I'm fine getting a night bus even if it's a long old journey, or if I have to get a ride I insist on a black cab), often only at the instance of my friends, but there's no way I'll be getting one ever again.

Used to cancel for many reasons. \n\nYou have to remember that sometimes we accept jobs when we’re driving. It only takes a tap and we don’t usually have that long to accept. Now, once accepting, if we realise that you’re actually too far away for a short trip, we’ll cancel. Uber’s rates suck, and they’ve only gotten worse as of lately. For example, if I have to drive a mile for a pickup, and the destination is only a mile, I’ll typically make £3.75 for that journey. It just isn’t worth it.\n\nI see that you’ve mentioned that you have a 5 star rating so this doesn’t apply to you, but sometimes when we’re driving and accept, we’ll pull over to double check the route as well as the rating. If I didn’t see your rating before and now see it’s like 3.75, I’ll cancel. It’s just too much hassle.\n\nIf it’s surging, and I accept assuming you were in the surge area but you weren’t, that’s also a reason to cancel. No point doing a 1x job when I can pick up a potential 2-5x. \n\nIf I accept and Bolt gives me a better job with a better rate, I’ll cancel.\n\nSome other drivers cancel if you’re going into the congestion zone (as you have to pay congestion charge now, even as a PCO driver.). So if you’re out of the zone and the driver then realises, oh, you’re going into the zone, they’ll likely cancel.\n\nIf the normal route has traffic, and you have to do 20 more miles (e.g. taking the A406 to Heathrow vs M25), we’ll cancel. We no longer get paid for the additional miles, regardless of the route as it’s a flat rate charged at the beginning of the journey. There’s no point of spending that much longer in traffic for no reimbursement either. It really isn’t worth it. \n\nThose are just a few! Most of which are the reason why I stopped driving for Uber as a whole, it just isn’t what it used to be. Hope this has helped a little :)\n\nAlso have a f*ck tonne of good stories having driven for a few years, those are definitely priceless!', 'It apparently drives up the prices if all of them keep accepting and cancelling rides. \n\nTrying to come home from a city centre on a Saturday night is next to impossible if you’re using Uber alone now.', ""Most Uber drivers are running multiple apps.

Happened so much to me of late I’m wondering if it’s an easy way for drivers to make a buck. Oh and good luck ever getting it back from Uber.

I'm having to move and just started searching for rooms and I forgot just how shocking and demeaning the whole process is. I've seen a couple of places and what was on offer was just pure squalor, bathtubs rusting, tatty furniture - the thing is you can't see the reality of it all in the photos, you have to see it for yourself in person.

I feel like a piece of meat, like a cash cow, no dignity to be had here. I call the phone numbers on Spare Room, Facebook, Zoopla, mostly no answer, I leave a voicemail, never get a callback, my messages echo in a black hole, as no replies are to be seen, agents' number one line that they simply have to say to you 'Let me know ASAP because the room is gonna go instantly'. And the scams! Oh the scams! Ads that show compilations of spacious rooms from a variety of houses offering a promise of reasonable rent only to reel you in - Sorry that's not available! But we have 10 other (more expensive) rooms.

I'm being shown around properties by what looks like a 17-year-old boy. Agents 45 min late, not bothering to let me know or apologise, while I wait outside the property in the middle of my workday. One thing I learned the hard way - don't mention you work from home, because you might be a more undesirable tenant - being discriminated against because you work from home is a brand new area to navigate.

Did I mention 'agents' who can't write a full, grammatically correct sentence?

I think this is just the beginning of things I will see this time around. The things I have seen in London I have never ever seen in any of the other 4 European countries I lived in. It really makes me question sometimes why I even bother being here.

Many are operating as walk in centres and don't need an appointment, though some need booking online.

These are fast tests specifically designed for people who don't have symptoms and you'll get the results **within a few hours**.

The idea is to track spread in the community - but ideal if you think you might have been exposed and are worried you could be carrying/spreading it, or perhaps you're planning to enter a new support bubble over Christmas.

**People who do have symptoms should continue requesting the more accurate PCR tests online or calling 119 and should not go to the walk in centres**

From anecdotal experience it seems the walk in centres aren't asking for proof you're a resident of the borough in question (although might want to check this - but the websites make no mention of it) so if your borough hasn't launched yet, you may want to try across the border if you live near a site in another borough - although remember that Tier 4 advice is to **stay local** where possible.

After drinking a few too many, we decided to call it a day and get the tube home. When we got to the station, we decided to have a race down the escalators. I sensibly took the one going down, my mate chose the one going up, which was quickly followed by him falling down and doing a comedy sort of continous fall. \n\nHe managed to bust his nose/face up pretty badly and I was worried he had a concussion, so when we got onto the carriage, I did my best to stop him from going to sleep. \n\nUnfortunately, he got super woozy and declared he was going to be sick.

Get out before we release the dogs.”', 'Mine was a pre-pandemic experience. This was when tubes were constantly packed during rush hours. \n\nThis particular story happens on the Piccadilly line at the height of rush hour. Naturally there’s barely any room, yet like absolute idiots, people deem their journey more worthy than minor breathing room for the current passengers and force their way onto the carriage at each stop. We get about three stops in and I swear, there’s no more space. There’s a poor lady that can’t be pushing more than 5 ft 1 and she’s lost, completely squished. I’m holding onto my coffee for dear life and I can’t even drink it, that’s how packed it was. Out of nowhere, this pure genius with his stupid wheeled briefcase seems he absolutely needs this tube and the one 2 minutes after won’t do, it can’t wait for Mr important. He proceeds to force his way into the carriage, back first. The current passengers groan and huff for being condensed together even more, wind being drawn out from us. By some pure miracle he has a slither of room to stand inside, he’s elated of his achievement to make an already miserable commute, that bit more miserable because he’s so important. Or so he thought. \n\nThe tube prepares to leave the station, the announcer mumbles over the loudspeaker that the doors are closing and the train is about to depart. Mr important is feeling chipper about his achievement, then bam. His whole world collapsed. Just as the doors were closing, in his delighted delirium, he lost his spacial awareness and wasn’t paying attention to the doors. They closed on his head. Briefly trapping his noggin between its steel (maybe aluminium?) grasp. \n\nMuch to the delight of the squished commuters, the karmic dice rolled in our favour. Laughter, exhalations and sniggers rolled around the door area at what a beautiful sight we witnessed at the expense of mr important. Like a tomato, or a traffic light, his head lit up, pure red from embarrassment. \n\nThat my dear Redditors, is my best tube story.

The guy got on the train and about 100 or more school children were surrounding this guy chanting and shouting nonce and pedo at him.
