I still do somewhat. However, after being robbed at needlepoint by a deranged drug addict who told me he had AIDS, and on a separate occasion badly beaten by a group of 4 drug addicted young men - my opinion has changed somewhat. I don’t think we should allow drug addicts to congregate in tents in public areas, because there is power in numbers and they have an addiction they will take advantage. I have friends who are addicts, and I have lost friends who are addicts and I feel very badly for them. They are deep down good people. But so am I and so are a lot of these people who are being assaulted just going about their daily lives. \n\nSo if we’re talking about homeless people with mental illness, or even people with alcohol problems then yes, don’t move their tents. But when drug addicts start congregating and assaulting and robbing people, it’s a different story. I agree addicts needs help and support. But helping and supporting them is not allowing them to rob and beat people and making it easy for them to continue life like this. \n\nAlso, are you aware how many rapes happen to homeless women? A tent will not fix that, and in fact, it gives people a more private place to sexually assault women who are down on their luck.', ""Sorry to this post, but noone is coming into my cafe to use the toilet, no exceptions. Especially with all the takeaway pints happening and people coming in solely to go for a piss and nothing more when they buy from a pub only 20 meters away. And yes, I am still someone who follows covid guidelines and its not on until the pubs do that outdoor table setup. I can't stand the young oompa loompas coming out looking like an absolute state with ciders in hand and without a care in the world. Homeless people, or men in suits, it doesn't matter, they won't be allowed in either.\n\nAs for the tents? On one hand I am not going to kick a tent or rummage through it, but at the same time, tent city on Henry street is becoming so large that people are coming into town just to see if its as bad as people say it is. Its getting out of hand and in a cashless society the homeless are getting more aggressive and desperate. It needs addressing and more than simply dropping a pair of gloves or a bag of tayto by the tents. But the current shower in power don't give a fuck."", 'Went into the city centre yesterday, it’s a disgrace the government aught to be ashamed of themselves. They really need to do something about this homeless housing situation. In addition to this the city centre is shameful and embarrassing it’s gone to the dogs. The place is filthy dirty and litter everywhere. It’s like stepping into the unknown. Tourism will suffer that’s for sure.', 'Couldn\'t disagree with this sentiment more. If a rich person was covering the city in human shit, used needles there\'d be a revolution to get them out.\n\n Just because these people are druggy tramps that couldnt give a fuck about the city, i should tolerate them? Great having tourists over to be tormented by degenerates. ""Scuse me can i 2 euro for de bus"" ....\n\nno thanks.', 'I wonder what self-righteous, delusional white knight in training stricken with vast visions of grandeur put these up with a ""profound"" sense of moral piousness. \n\nFirstly, not every homeless person out there is living in a tent on the streets out of unforeseen circumstances beyond their own control. Let\'s stop bullshitting ourselves here with empathic fantasy talk. Among the few poor homeless people suffering from severe mental illness, or sincerely down on hard times wandering the city, many are out there because they\'re extremely volatile drug addicts who would much rather prefer sleeping in a doorway, begging, than to go to a shelter where they have to turn over their fix of choice and comply with rules. \n\nMany will never change and refuse to even attempt to get their lives together. Why would they when the bulk of society showers them with undeserved pity, charitable donations and blind tolerance, while the government literally caters to the demons that got them in the positions they\'re in to begin with (i.e. injection centres, methadone clinics)? \n\nSecondly, why should a business owner who\'s worked his/her ass off to realize their dream, enduring long sleepless hours studying for degrees, cutting through mounds of red tape, acquiring licenses, combating city council pushback, getting reamed by local taxes, sacrificing blood, sweat and tears to keep that business thriving and alive, be held accountable for the welfare of a stranger who happens to set up their tent and loiter in the doorway of said business panhandling, intimidating potential customers? \n\nHell, lots of these cafes give away free takeaway coffees and the like on a daily basis to vagrants out of the kindness of their own hearts. They\'re not obligated to. Just like Hotel owners aren\'t obligated to put your whole family of ten up in a swanky room for free because you and your able bodied partner refuse to work, have turned down three houses offered by the state because they\'re located outside of the city and, ""All of me children\'s mates are all in the same school in Dublin."", and you can\'t figure out how contraception works. \n\nListen, I feel for you being homeless and all, and my heart goes out to you, but for fuck\'s sake, take some ownership for your predicament. It is not some Cafe owner\'s responsibility to make sure you have enough to eat and a place to sleep for the night. They\'re eating a shit sandwich just like you buddy (just like the rest of us), only difference being, yours is unquestionably bigger. Living on the streets and whatnot. \n\nBut guess what? If that ""hipster cafe"" owner is unable to pull in business because would be paying customers can\'t traverse the shanty town of tents set up at the entrance, they become just another statistic. Homeless because they couldn\'t pay bills, rent, or stay afloat long enough to save their business. \nThen again, I highly doubt most would end up in any other situation than persevering and overcoming obstacles. See, it\'s that kind of hard work and mentality that made them business owners to begin with. \n\nThirdly, why is it that throughout all my meandering through the city, I\'ve yet to encounter a homeless child begging? It\'s usually a grown ass, adult man asking for spare change outside of Lidl, at 11 am on a Tuesday. Sometimes they even excuse themselves from panhandling to take a call. On their smartphone. Give me a break.\n\nMe and my Wife both work full-time jobs and are childless by choice because we live in the city and can\'t afford them. We get zero help from the government; financial or other. If we have expensive bills one moth, or the landlord decides to raise the rent, we have to either cut back on spending, increase our hours at work, or start looking for another place to live. But I digress.\n\nFunny enough, guarantee this sign wasn\'t even put up by an actual homeless person, as most just want to be left alone and not attract unwarranted attention.

We’ve decided motorists are never going to learn and so we have to create this really complicated, expensive and often counter-productive infrastructure because drivers won’t make allowances for the safety of cyclists.\nI can see the counter-arguments and I’m not saying there isn’t a place for segregated cycle lanes in certain cases, but what we should be aiming for is the harmonious sharing of our public thoroughfares by all road users.\nThis might seem stupid until you try use these lanes. Often, they place a line of parking space between the road and the lane which means cars can’t see you and tend to turn right or left straight through you...big oof. There’s a counter-flow cycle lane in Cork like this down Washington Street that is just a fatality waiting to happen.\nWhen you want to turn yourself, you have a series of dangerous manoeuvres to make to cross lanes which involve stopping (impeding cyclists behind you) and negotiating across lanes without momentum.\nYou’ve also got the pain in the hole of a bunch more traffic lights - one for pedestrians, one for cyclists and one for cars slowing down commuting time even more.\nPersonally, I think these lanes are useful for families with small children, but for cyclists who want to get from A to B, they are only a hindrance. \nThey also increase the sense that cyclists don’t belong on the road (we do) and makes drivers resent us even more. \nTwo wheels good...four wheels good.

Some areas have been developed and modernised brilliantly without losing their character. Other areas have been horribly neglected and could do with just being nuked and redeveloped from scratch.

I work on Wicklow street and I quite enjoy the area. A lot more closed shop fronts after COVID now but in general this area has a nice atmosphere to it during the day. Obviously this can vary a lot though with time of day and how busy the pubs are. \n\nI really don’t know what DCC are doing with O Connell Street, it’s just kind of abandoned. I’m sure there’s years of red tape involved with anything though.', 'According to the videos and pictures from the past, Dublin looks 100 times better than ever now, especially the city centre...', 'I have an international perspective, and this may not go over well! Compared to a few other large cities in Europe I would say Dublin is averagely clean, but after Covid it’s hard to say properly because everywhere is dealing with empty storefronts. Compared to London, Toronto, Paris, Dublin is pristine &amp; hasn’t lost any charm, compared to Stockholm or Berlin it’s average. I do notice you Dubliners have a special breed of hatred towards local government, it’s quite admirable!', 'There are several issues:\n\n1) Dublin’s city centre is largely commercial and office based - hardly anyone lives above shops anymore, there’s hardly any mixed use spaces - the city itself outside of the south and north circular roads is pretty low density - so we don’t get the kind of transportation that other European cities have or the same kind of connectivity - it’s not seen as profitable. \n\n2) because we don’t have dense suburbs - there’s no public transport links in the city centre bar buses pretty much. So how do you get around the city centre without walking? Cycling an option - but that’s unattractive politically because the very roads needed to make cycle lanes are needed to connect the poorly planned suburbs to the city centre. So we’ve established it’s a car and bus dependant city, further to add we can’t have greenways that connect to the countryside, I’m Waterford city it’s been so successful. \n\n3) we can’t have nice plazas or thoroughfares without traffic - (i.e. College Green Pedestrianisation, or O Connell St Pedestrianisation) There’s no place in the city we’re you can sit down and enjoy the city without it being either in a park on the south side or in Phoenix Park, or on the side of a street with lots of foot traffic or general vehicle traffic.\n\n4) Rationalisation of drug policy - we’re still playing with this war on drug rationality - most people agree cannabis should just be legalised at this point and regulated - but other harder drugs should be facilitated in drug treatment and administration centres - but of course people object to where they should be placed (Merchants Quay Injection Centre for example) \n\n5) Lack of diversity in who lives in the city centre - if you live in the city centre your either a rich student in all those purpose built student accommodation, your a tourist in a hotel, or your someone who’s renting a room in shared accommodation, or it’s a studio flat. That’s pretty much it. We need all types of people living in the city centre.\n\n6) We dont market the great things in the city enough - we just latch onto tourist traps. The national galleries and museums, the beautiful architecture, all the stories and history behind Dublin’s streets, obviously covid has made everything worse but we need more festivals in the city more events happening in the streets. If you look at Belfast and how they tell the story of their city, even look at the feile festival or how they’re revitalising the Irish language - all great things that bring in tourists but also bring in locals alike.\n\n7) protestors need a dedicated area for protesting - not much space outside Leinster house so they do it on O Connell Street. Whatever your views that’s fair enough but O Connell Street is a space for everyone, not just religious nut heads yelling verses from the bible, anti vax, anti climate change or pro life activists.\n\n8) the city needs to stop relying on retail and fast food to sustain itself commercially. O Connell street is filled with corner stores, fast food chains and retail - people are only going there for a reason, they need places that are there for people to have experiences. \n\n9) the nightlife industry needs to change - the city lacks nightlife bar temple bar which is a tourist trap. Closing hours for pubs need to be changed and transport links need to be made available so people can do things in the city at night time - bringing life into the city at night - not just through drinking is proven to deter crime in built up areas at night.  \n\n10) a pet peeve of mine but DCC need to stop laying down expensive stone pavements on streets only for them to be pulled up and tar to be added and things like that. Also more trees!\n\nAt the end of the day Dublin needs to become a city that people in this country live in, not just commute to work in. And when I say live I mean actually having a life and doing nice things having past times etc, engaging with the local economy. Right now people aren’t really living in the city and it’s a bit of a tourist trap, but it is better than it was in the 80s virtually every part of Ireland is.', ""also smelly, especially the roads branching off the O'Connell street.

To do so is just idiocy. \n\nI love my hometown."", 'Sending D12 love, brother', 'Head up king , Tallaght ftw', 'Tallaght isnt even that bad? Dunno why it gets such a bad rep. Lived in worse places in Dublin and came from eastern europe theres no comparison there lol', ""I bought in tallaght 20 years ago having been priced out of my home area D6.  Lived there for 17 years, raising a family, i have since sold up and left as I wanted to live closer to my family area as i get older and can now afford to do so.. but I can say for certain, there is absolutely nothing wrong with tallaght (that isn't wrong in every other large working class area - blanch, clondalkin, lucan, finglas, swords, cabra, crumlin, etc...)\n\nI myself am a professional working at a senior enough level, I know many teachers, nurses, guards, artists, executives who live in or are from tallaght.\n\nTo all those people who say they cannot afford a home in Dublin  there are many very decent areas in tallaght proper where you will get a lovely house with decent neighbours; old Bawn, Springfield, Avonmore, glenview, balrothery, Bancroft, kilnamanagh, Kingswood, kiltipper, and many more..\n\nPeople talk about tallaght like its some sort of non stop mania.  Having lived there for 17 years I never was attacked, threatened, intimidated or robbed, nor did I ever see anything like that happen.  There are parks everywhere, sports clubs, schools and every possible amenity.  I would 100% recommend tallsght over the many soulless commutter towns that are out of control with developments.. leixlip, celbridge, adamstown, tyrellstown, rathcoole etc.\n\nI have a feeling most people that comment negatively on tallaght have never been there or are just trolls looking to get a rise out of people that do live there.\n\nIf you're thinking of moving to tallaght visit the road/estate at the weekends, late at night, see what the neighbours are getting up to.  Look for vans parked on the road, if you're lucky you'll have a load of tradesmen as neighbours.\n\nAlso to clear up the debate, firhouse is not in tallaght.  It is in Dublin 24.  I'm sure most people realise Dublin codes may encompass more than one area?  Eg. Dublin 4 has Ringsend and ballsbridge- shocker!   Firhouse is firhouse, and it too has its share of issues, as does sandyford, as does dun laoghiare, as does raheny.\n\nFinally in relation to the East West spilt in tallaght.  Yes it is true there is more social deprivation in West tallaght than East.  But in reality it is very unlikely an outsider is going to buy a house in kilinardin, jobstown, Fettercairn,  brookview etc. unless you are from those areas.  It would be the equivalent of moving into a flat in inner city Dublins ballybough, summerhill or Oliver bond.  The vast majority of people in those areas are quiet community driven people who want to get on with their lives. They do have an understanding of each others ways which an outsider might struggle with...my advice would be to consider if you are willing to become part of that community before moving there and if so you should try to conceptualise what that actually entails for your future and family."", ""I'd probably open with, South side, hbu? 🛥"", ""As a Cork man i like Tallaght - especially the song -\n\n'Tallaght - Tallaght Ford - Four Double Oh, Double Oh, Double Four !"", ""Some decades back Tallaght used to be a very rough area, very rough indeed.\n\nBut not anymore.\n\nNow it only has small shrinking pockets of roughness.

qgps6w,LisaAshlie,t3_qgps6w,A very Dublin story,2021.0,10.0,27.0,"I have left Ireland in the last year and just woke up to this forum and randomly thought of a story that at the time made me die of shame but now makes me laugh. 

A few years ago I got laser eye surgery in one of those posh clinics somewhere out by ballsbridge and after it my eyes were fucked red and had sunglasses on to stop the light.  Anyway, long story short I hoped on the red line to get to hueston Station from the city centre.

Without thinking, I sat beside a junkie and a very dodgy looking fat lad in all grey tracksuit bottoms who was trying to ask everyone for credit so he could call a lad(who he did) and came in the luas and he gave him a fix.  

I actually let him use my phone to shut him up because luckily I had a shity brick 30 euro shitebox that no one would bother robbing. He continued blabing on about how sound I was and how everyone else on the luas were pricks because they wouldn't hand him their phones for drug deals. 

We were at about the 4 courts when he kind of had a moment of soberness and tells me, you're sitting in pissss luvv 😐😅I said what and he goes onto tell me that a junkie pissed himself on that seat before you got on and left.  Sure enough I looked down and my pants were drowned in piss. 😐

Then the 2 scummy dealer junkies proceeded to laugh and shout at the top of their lungs ""ah heeeere she's sitting in piss, this wan is sitting in junkies piss "" something along those lines. At this point the whole carriage was looking at me.  Then just in time the stop for hueston came.  I got my bag, pulled myself together with my red eyes, hardly able to see infront of me and did the walk of shame past everyone, whilst the 2 junkies kept screaming pissy ass , yer one, look at the piss on her arse, whilst my arse was visible to everyone as I got off and walked to the station and now everyone knew the truth, I did indeed have a junkie pissy arse.

\---

This is a sad post for us, but maybe a happy opportunity for you.

We have a French Bulldog (Princess Leia), whom is absolutely wonderful (and well trained).  She is pee-pad trained, as well as potty trained.  She is also crate trained.  She knows a few commands such as: come, touch, place, luke, sit, down, shake (paw), high five, rollover, off, bang, and leave it.  She has a skateboard as well, and does pretty good skating around the house (she can't turn yet ;-)

She is SUPER loving and loves everyone and all the other dogs she meets. She is also fixed (spayed). She doesn't bark much, except if she sees someone on a skateboard from her window in the house ... Which generally prompts her to go looking for her own.

She's almost completely black, and is on the small size for a Frenchie, perfect for city living.  She is very healthy, and very muscular.  She is also IKC registered.

As, with all Frenchie's, she is also a lot of work!  She will easily get an upset tummy if she eats something not on her normal diet (which we keep very strict, for her own comfort).  She is very distracted while not in her home space.... Meaning her recall (come) and other types of commands, sometimes are ignored ;-). So she needs much more training with distractions yet ...

The sad part:  I have cancer, and unfortunately, as a family we are all concentrating very hard on other priorities at this time and can not spend the adequate time to ensure Princess Leia's continued training and happiness.  We are looking for the right forever home for her, so if you'd like to meet her, please direct message me here on Reddit and tell us a little more about your current living situation and your history with dogs and dog training.  Also, please let us know if you've had experience with Frenchie's, in particular.",270.0,0.98,38.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"[""You've cancer and your making sure your dog is looked after..

A group of [Sandymount](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Sandymount) residents is appealing to the [National Transport Authority](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=National+Transport+Authority) (NTA) to urgently alter the new BusConnects C-Spine route which only came into service on Sunday.

The C-Spine is the second of the redesigned [Dublin](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_topic=Dublin) bus network routes to begin operating, with buses running from [Maynooth](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Maynooth), Celbridge, [Leixlip](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Leixlip), and [Lucan](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Lucan), through the city to [Ringsend](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Ringsend) and Sandymount. It follows the introduction last June of the H-Spine from [Howth](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Howth) and [Malahide](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Malahide).

While the C-Spine routes from west Dublin remain largely as published by the NTA in 2020, the Sandymount end of the route has been altered to remove buses from Strand Road.

The change has been introduced to facilitate Dublin City Council’s plans to begin a one-way system on Strand Road to make space for a cycle path. The [High Court](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=High+Court) in July ruled the cyclepath required planning permission. The council is appealing the court’s decision.

#### Strand Road not used

Sandymount residents said they only realised in recent weeks the BusConnects plan had been changed to use Gilford Road and [Park](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Park) Avenue instead of Strand Road.

“Park Avenue is a narrow residential road and at some points it is physically impossible for two buses to pass each other without one mounting the kerb. Under this new BusConnects route there will be buses every two minutes at peak times and approximately every four minutes after that. That sort of frequency is unthinkable,” said [Kevin Byrne](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kevin+Byrne) of the Park Avenue Action Group.

Up to the middle of November maps on the NTA’s website showed the C-Spine route using Strand Road, said Mr Byrne.

* [Transport official put under pressure to set out MetroLink timeline](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/transport-official-put-under-pressure-to-set-out-metrolink-timeline-1.4725854)

“We have had no engagement on this with the NTA. We made submissions to the BusConnects consultation on the basis of a route that no longer exists. We presumed that, given the courts quashed the council’s cycle route plan, the NTA would use Strand Road.”

The group said because Sandymount is the route’s terminus, buses could use a loop system so they would run in one direction only on Park Avenue. “Without mitigation measures Park Avenue will become a service road for buses hammering up and down willy-nilly. It will be carnage,” said Mr Byrne.

Fine Gael Cllr Paddy McCartan said he would be calling on council management to liaise with the NTA to resolve the issue.

“It makes sense for the route to revert to Strand Road. The whole purpose of BusConnects is to serve as many areas as possible. Excluding Stand Road is excluding half of Sandymount and causing a huge safety issue on narrow Park Avenue.”

An NTA spokesman said new alignment appears on the Transport for [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news) website and in materials distributed to households in the area “in recent weeks”.

Bus routes, which are being discontinued under the network redesign, had been diverted from Strand Road to Park Avenue earlier this year and it was the NTA’s preference to continue with this flow for the new C routes, instead of using a one-way loop-back system

“Experience shows that, wherever possible, having bus routes use the same roads in both directions is preferred by the majority of passengers \[and prospective passengers\] as it provides a simpler, easier-to-use network,” he said.

“As always, operations around the implementation of C-Spine will be closely monitored and appropriate actions taken where necessary.” The NTA has been engaging with council officials, he said. “We understand that the legal process in respect of the proposed cycle scheme is ongoing.”

The network redesign involves scrapping the current numbering system for all buses. A new lettering system from A to H will identify eight “spines” through the city, with buses running every four to eight minutes. Numbers will be used to indicate different branches of a spine.

#### What is the new fare?

Separately a new 90-minute fare, which will allow passengers to transfer between public transport services in Dublin for €2.30, came into operation on Sunday.

Passengers can use Dublin Bus, Luas and most Dart, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin within 90 minutes of initial departure, without incurring extra charges.

The TFI 90-minute fare will be €2.30 for adults and students when using their Leap card during a promotional period to remain in place until the end of March, 2022. The price will then increase to €2.50.

A new flat 80 cent Leap card fare for children has also been introduced.",265.0,0.94,134.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"['I am more and more convinced that we really get the leaders we deserve, cause the leaders come from amongst us.', 'Listen, just stop being poor.', ""&gt;“Without mitigation measures Park Avenue will become a service road for buses hammering up and down willy-nilly.

They were months trying to install the lane but they kept having to work around cars which were never moved so the lane would be completed to a point, a car would be in the way and then would continue again past it.

Basically, I've been looking into CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) because I have pretty bad anxiety, because of the domain she owns her website came up pretty quick as I was looking for places.

I scheduled an appointment with her, the first is free, thank God. But, she genuinely doesn't seem to understand the role of CBT. I'd rather not give the full details of the session because I don't necessarily want to share my problems with strangers online,  but here's the details that hopefully show she's not up to the task.

She asked if I was on antidepressants (I am) and then told me that she doesn't agree with proscribing anything. Counsellors, therapists and all aren't allowed comment on meds really because they aren't doctors 

She explained that the goal of CBT is to make one stop caring about the problems at hand, so she couldn't help me because she agrees that what's causing my anxiety is an important issue. That's not the goal, it's about coping strategies and getting at the root of why the anxiety is there, that's like if I was anxious about the housing crisis and she said she couldn't help because she also hadn't a mortgage.

After saying that she didn't agree with proscribing meds, she then told me that once they kick in I'll be anesethised to what's worrying me anyway so I shouldn't panic too much, which isn't what antidepressants do for a start, and also comes off as her backpedalling.

I've spoken to a few therapists since, and all of them were shocked by how she conducted herself. As I said, she isn't properly accredited either, I learned after. 

Anyway, CBT is supposed to be good, I'm still looking into it. But she is at best bad at her job and at worst irresponsible, like, telling someone who is mentally unwell that they shouldn't take meds and their anxiety is true, that's not a good thing to be at.

 Below are links to decent counselling/therapy places that I've found. Get help if you need help, but jaysus make sure the person ""helping"" knows what they're at.

Streets apparently aren't safer if he died on them"", 'Not just Dublin rent in any large town in Ireland is ridiculous.', 'Yes, although London is probably worse. \n\nI have been working in continental Europe for the past ten years, in a few different countries. While nowhere is perfect (think of the eye-watering rents in Paris, for example), there are some major European cities that shit all over Dublin in terms of quality of life/affordability (Vienna and Berlin, for instance, although that is changing slowly). \n\nA few factors that play into this are sufficient building of social housing, rent controls and provision of excellent public services. The problem with doing this in an Irish context is that Irish people generally don’t want to pay higher taxes to fund these things. That attitude is understandable insofar as the return you get from public services is very low at present, but things are unlikely to change for the ordinary person until policy makers address the big picture.\n\nLooking at who we elect to govern us, I don’t see much critical thinking or backbone in terms of standing up to vested interests.\n\nSo unless there are massive mobilizations away from the main parties, it’s unlikely to change. FFG and the establishment media have been startled by the rise of SF, but as far as I can see, their main response has been to pull the Provo Scare rather than addressing the factors that have seen their vote share rise, namely that FFG refuse to regulate the property market in any meaningful way.\n\nIt will probably take a SF/PBP/Social Democrat election win to startle those running the country into tackling these issues.', 'How do we solve this crisis?\n\nFor me there are only three long term solutions:\n\n1. Build up. Dublin has been suffering from urban sprawl for decades and the sheer amount of land used to house people that are working in a very economically dense city is ridiculous. Housing estates in Meath and Kildare being built and marketed as ""perfect for Dublin commute"", relying on a 45 minute car journey at off peak times.\n\n2. Decentralise economic activity from Dublin. For me this is more sustainable long term. We need to strengthen regional towns and cities to take the pressure of Dublin in terms of people moving their from the rest of the country. If there is more work (or remote work) viable in other cities balanced evenly throughout the country (Limerick, Galway, Cork, Sligo, Waterford, Athlone) we can develop dense housing strategies there to keep affordability and simultaneously take the demand off the Dublin housing market.\n\n3. The most radical and pie in the sky solution: socialise all housing. I\'m unapologetically socialist when it comes to housing, I think profiteering off a crisis is sick.', 'Dublin is shocking for rent prices compared to income. I rent a two bedroom apartment in Brooklyn for $1600, which is about €1300. It’s crazy that I can’t move home because I couldn’t afford a decent standard of living compared to New York of all places.

What if my rent goes up tomorrow and I can't afford the place? What if I need to move but cannot find a place for 6 months? And you know when people live in shared places that barely qualify to be called a room it's not like you can stay with friends on a couch for a while till you get somewhere to rent.\n\nIf you want to relocate further out you need a car and anyone who drives knows the crazy insurance prices you could be paying for a shitty 500 euro car so that's not always an option  either \n\n Like for developed country we really are one big mess of a Capital City."", 'Yes', 'One of?\nLmao', 'Unfortunately yes!', 'Yes, end of!', ""When it comes to rough sleeping, which the OP seems focused on, no Dublin is not one of the worst cities in Europe.

If you want to talk send me a DM"", 'Greetings, and good you\'ve reached out on Reddit here, and so much support coming in.  I also want to echo what others are mentioning. Regarding living at home, life is hard enough without having to worry about rent! I think it\'s actually smart staying in a family home in Dublin, and not paying rent monthly (for as long as you can) . I know plenty of people who have moved back home, and I say well done to them, smart move!! Whether you realise, and you need to hear it... it\'s a blessing you have a home in Dublin, the pressure of paying rent is crazy. Rent prices are gone astronomical in Dublin (take a look on Daft), I\'ve mates who are paying in excess of 1800€ a month, and rents are even higher in other places.  So please don\'t give living at home a second thought, you\'ll find that the large majority of people renting actually have no other choice (aka. no family home in the city)! \n\nI also highly recommend PIETA House, nothing short of amazing! I know some Counsellors working there, and friends who have lost loved ones are continuing to avail. PIETA have absolute zero judgment!\n\nHonestly, we are all walking different paths in life, on different time-lines, no two time-lines are the same. The reality is, for everyone life is hard and difficult road, and sadly our education doesn\'t nearly cover the important life/living skills! \n\nMore so, and more importantly to hear... we all need to literally stop filling our minds with ideas of following ""some"" expected life template / predefined tradition paths (just because others done so before).  You control your own life, you have your own free-will! How do you define &amp; compare failure / success? - The answer is, you can\'t compare lives, it\'s impossible as we are on different paths. (the expression goes, one man\'s success, is another person\'s failure). You\'ve taken the right first step reaching out here, and absolutely do feel free to DM anytime.\n\nMind yourself, and trust that things will get better. (They really will!! But it requires some courage and change to happen) . Stuck in a rut... it\'s honestly that time to change something now, start with one small bit! (cause if you change nothing, then it\'s on repeat cycle! ). What\'s next, what can you progress on, one step. You\'ll be amazed how powerful a feeling it can be on building upon the little things. \n\nWhen we\'re younger, decisions and our paths are often set out for us already (little thinking required), however when we hit our 20\'s / 30`s /40`s then we need to really start thinking of our own paths, what\'s next and what we want in life. You\'ve got this! Keep on this thread here. \n\nJust promise us one thing today please... do try stop talking overly-critical to yourself, take off the pressure, it\'s not justified at all okay (*we all have a habit of being too self-critical of ourselves) . I\'ll let you in on a secret, I\'m in my early 40\'s, and hey many people I know are still figuring things out and have unknowns, it\'s part of living. We figure things out as we go.', ""Try Woebot app. Very good, based on solid psychology and it doesn't involve talking to anyone"", 'Alright.  I\'m gonna level with you. Think of me as your older brother. \n\nGet better and stay better. \n\nFirst thing you need to do is wake up early, real early. 7am is perfect. To get up early you need to go to bed early. 10pm to 11pm give or take. \n\nSecond, start exercising. When you get up go for a jog. 5k goal is a great start. Jog every second day. Get a workout plan for your body - mix of calisthenics and weight lifting. Stick to it, no excuses. \n\nThird, sort your diet. Eat three meals a day, make sure its balanced. No more chippers or take aways. Cook it yourself.  Learn to cook a dozen or meals that take about 20/40 minutes to make. \n\nFourth, buy a bunch of books. Wordsworth editions cost about two or three quid with books that cover some of the most important canon in literature. No comics, game books or crappy self help books. Buy actual books. Poems are good too. \n\nFifth, use the internet correctly. No more social media. You\'ll be tempted to show off or watch other people do it. Its useless and bragging always lessens the deed. Watch important films. Watch videos that\'ll improve you. No twitch. No porn. Seriously, stop watching porn.\n\nSixth, forget other people. You feel crappy and your signals are all wrong. Find something really tough to do and stick to it. It\'ll help you build character. Theres a lot of crappy people out there and the way to distinguish yourself is to have character.  \n\nSeventh, get a job if you haven\'t already. Who cares what your excuse is? There\'s always a way. Supplement it with either a skill or education. If you feel like you\'re worth more than the jobs at hand then you\'d have a better job already.\n\nEight, start saving your money. Aim for a couple of grand. You\'re not paying rent so thats at least 30% of your income you could be saving. It\'ll bring you security. Don\'t spend above your needs. \n\nNine, consider your position carefully. Why should anyone help you? If you\'re lucky you might have your family to support you. But you weren\'t born so others can hold you up. You won\'t respect yourself if you don\'t do anything respectful. Accept where and what you are now so you can move on. \n\nFinally, why the hell are you on this platform asking for help when there is so much work to do? \n\nConsider this very famous line;\n""we only live, only suspire/Consumed by either fire or fire"". \nMeaning that no matter what you do you\'re gonna suffer. So suffer well. \n\nYou\'re a great guy bud but let\'s see what can be done with you, okay?  Don\'t lean on any crutches and fight hard with yourself. I\'m rooting for you.\n\nEdit: Just re-reading for spelling and realised I made a presumption that you\'re a guy. If you\'re a girl this still applies. \n\nIt may seem hard and compassion is important but in the years leading to your 24th birthday, what have we to show for it? \n\nIf you\'re mentally ill you will need to find treatment for it, regardless of gender. Medicine is medicine. Being sick brings compromise into peoples lives and this may be one of them. \n\nBut being human is likewise non-negotiable. And one needs to accept that having a healthy routine will bring about a healthier lifestyle and mentality. \n\nLikewise we are built to be social - but we also want nice things. If you can\'t accept yourself then keep working hard until you can. And until you can, fight as hard as you can with yourself to not stop working hard.

The reality is that things can always get better. You don't need a grand plan, you just need to take some positive steps for yourself.

For me, I bumped into someone I knew from a temp job I'd had a few years earlier. We caught up and he said he'd put in a word for me at his new workplace. It lead to me getting a fairly menial, low-paying job that I've since turned into a career for myself.

I agree that you should put some effort in the way you look but also there are times to relax. It's not easy being judged on every step by the way you look.

And then drifted into how we don\'t go to the gym, whiten our teeth, moisturise our skin, dress.....\n\nAnd they couldn\'t see these things were related.\n\nPart of the issue here is that there is a false premise in the comment - that there is a fashion sense.  There\'s different social conventions in different societies.\n\nLocalities bring their own uniform, it\'s why people feel that they\'ve Irish clothes they can\'t wear abroad, and clothes from abroad that they\'d get slagged about but their GAA mates. In Berlin you wear black, and that\'s that, there isn\'t fashion, there\'s a uniform.\n\nFrance is similar. France isn\'t fashionable, there\'s a style but they\'ve very little fashion, at least in part because they dress conservatively. Both in terms of not taking fashion risks, but also because they don\'t take the risks associated with street harassment.\n\nWhereas here, women can wear short skirts without the near certainty that someone is going to feel them up on public transport.\n\nAnother thing that Irish people do is wear loud colours/ patterns in ways that our continental cousins, particularly the Northern ones, don\'t.\n\nAlso, women here don\'t tend to go for the high gloss look in a work environment, it\'s a going out look, and wouldn\'t be seen as professional in most work contexts.\n\nI wear suits a lot in work, and can wear pretty much whatever colours I like, we\'d be far more open to dressing up than the Anglo-Saxons\n\nI think an overarching element here, is that you can wear what you want. I\'ve friends who never get out of tweeds, others that wear to Dunnes what they wore to Berghain, others that look like Nordic architects that fetishise obtuse angles\n\nBut in general, ""wear what you want"", means that people wear something they\'re comfortable in. If a woman wants to wear leggings, she can. If your doctor wears jeans, that\'s fine. If your politician wants to wear a sports jersey, then the people giving him shit for it look bad.\n\nAnd actually being comfortable in the clothes matters, if you\'re wearing something you\'re not comfortable in, someone\'s going to call you out and slag the shite out of you for it.\n\nI\'m happy to wear my Italian suits that I picked  in Milan, my silk ties, and fancy shoes. Or bring a pox and wearing linen trousers in warm weather. Or wearing loud shirts with skinny jeans and blazers. And anyone that comes at me will get a hard knock back, on whatever they\'re wearing, if they want to play that game.\n\nNo one giving a shit about what you\'re wearing is great, so wear whatever suits you. I wouldn\'t change it for the world', ""I honestly kind of like the Irish affinity for the tracksuit and specifically tracksuit bottoms. Sure if you wear it to work you'll get stares and rightly so, but for things like college I don't see a problem with it. You're there to learn, not show off the fancy shirt you got at Topshop on sale."", 'Lol this thread is so overblown. People in Paris on average do not dress any better.

However, I have noticed that recently a lot of teens my age have been loosening up a bit. My friends now wear more 'continental' style clothing and have a more open mindset towards fashion.

Be calm.\n\nYou can't stop someone having one, so just look after them, let it run its course and be there for when they come around, which is often quite quickly.

People with epilepsy are people who have recurring seizures.\n\nFlashing lights is only a cause of seizures in about 3% - 5% of people who have epilepsy.  For the rest, they have no affect whatsoever.  Seizures have various triggers.  It is different for everyone.\n\nNot all seizures have people falling on the floor, rolling around etc.  Seizures come in all sorts of forms and levels of severity.  You can be sitting beside someone having a seizure and not know it.  Some are just a few seconds long and the person could appear to be daydreaming before coming back to normal.  If you weren't looking at them, you would not know they had had it.\n\nEpilepsy is not contagious and it is not a mental illness.

The D4, Malahide, and Drogheda crowd are super snobby, will always fall back and stick to their own, and really view people not from money as expendable. They've much nicer lives than me, going on their holidays three times a year in groups on daddy's money and they just don't give a shit about you, if you can't afford to be in that group. I know myself because my accent is quite pass-able as posh but when they figure out where I'm from, the attitude totally changes. \n\n I find it funny because that crowd is more judgemental than the rich internationals whose wealth dwarfs the Irish monied class in reality. I know a rich yank who got her horse flown into a farm down the country so she could go down and visit it on the weekends. Proper obscene stuff. The funny thing about the yanks is the same crowd will tell you to be more climate-conscious and cut emissions. I find the rich yanks' interest in social justice absolutely mind-bending ngl. \n\nDo I have a chip on my shoulder? Absolutely because I feel the same posh pricks are just as judgemental. I just try and out-perform them and every step and make a show of them academically because it proves they got in on their private education, not their talent.

Boojum: 6/10, IM SORRY I just feel like it's basically the Chipotle of Ireland and I feel Chipotle has a taste that is much closer to authentic with more spices and flavour overall 🥺

Pi: 10/10, amazing pizza, the cheese they use is 🤩, their margherita pie is worth trying! PRICEY

 Mykonos Taverna: 7/10, really good horiatiki salad and feta but I felt the meat was a little on the too greasy side but that is a personal opinion!

Xian: 10/10, this is easily some the best Chinese food I have ever had, no meal has ever disappointed me, got my first spice bag and 4 in 1 from here :)

OneSociety: 8/10, the brisket burger here is fantastic, pretty much all the lunch sandwiches here are! I felt that the roasted potatoes and pastas were a bit lacking, though (pricey!)

Joy of Cha: 8/10, great tea selection but my chai latte was still more just lightly spiced milk after letting it sit for 5 min +, food is good!

Cornucopia: 10/10, soo good but sooooo expensive

Murphy's Ice Cream: 8/10, try the brownie ice cream! (PRICEY)

Musashi: 9/10, great flavor but my one roll was just not that good, also pricey but most sushi places are

El Grito: 8/10, I'd say as close to authentic Mexican as you can find in Dublin

Sano Pizza: 9/10, sooo good, I would recommend getting aubergine on your pie!

Bunsen: 10/10, one of the best burgers I have EVER had, PRICEY though

""They lower density, they lead to traffic congestion and parking problems, and waste land for storing cars 24 hours a day.""  \nUp until about 1880, he said, cities functioned more like networked villages.

Residents were more likely to interact and function together....', ""I have to say, when I first moved to Dublin, I was pretty shocked there's no low emissions or ultra low emissions zone like there is in London.

What this has meant is people who can least afford it have had to replace these cars with newer models, which means that cars, that in some cases are used very little are getting scrapped prematurely or sold for use elsewhere. Ironically many of these cars end up here.\n\nAt a time when Covid related new car supply issues has driven the price of used cars up by 50% in some cases, the timing for that couldn\'t be worse.\n\nNot that a lot of people will care - but ULEZs also impact people who might keep ""neo-classics"" as hobby cars for occasional rather than daily use.

Proper policing of these would help.\nThe Dublin councils have tried bullying residents into giving away their front gardens for bus routes and because they are failing at that, move the goal posts and shoot a different direction. \nThey don't mind blocking roads at this time of year with all the roadworks to use up the EU subs before the deadline, but they should be using it to improve the infrastructure all year round.

Ehehe I'm sharing with you another funny experience regarding my life in Dublin.

Little recap. I'm an Italian chemical engineer and PhD student in TU Dublin and I really love this city, I don't want that you think that I spit on the plate on which I eat, I want just to share some experience.

So, my first big problem was in obtaining the PPSN, the covid caused a lot of delays and I solved that problem thanks to a guy here that give to me good advice.

Now I have spent these holidays here in Dublin, alone, because returning to Italy during a pandemic didn't seem a smart thing to me. So, I was quite sure that this would be a Christmas without gifts...I was wrong!

Today my Landlord told to me that I have to leave the room within January 28th...just to add a little bit of stress to my life.

Now to be clear, I'm a very tidy, clean, and calm tenant...I spend basically all the day studying.

So, now I have started to send mail to rent offers that fit my budget (poor budget) and I will have to do move all my things to another house.

I love Dublin, but the situation of the rent is really really horrible...I mean, I love what I do, so I can manage the situation and face the total lack of comfort, but the landlords here are really the greediest sons of....

So merry christmas and happy new year...( even if the beginning does not bode well)

I bought a Range Rover

Well

We got it on finance 

But it doesn't fit through the gates

It's a shame

Because it would look nice parked outside the house 

Beside George's Porsche

I feel tall in my Range Rover 

But I'm worried that the neighbours will think we had to sell the second car

Again

Because it's not in our driveway

But we didn't, I just bought a Range Rover

And it's parked on the street

Because it doesn't fit through the gates

In fact George's business is doing quite well

Sandra

Hugo from hockey's mother

She told me they are great for getting the dog and kids to Wexford

That's why I needed one 

To go down to the summer house 

I'm glad we didn't sell that

When George's first business closed up 

2008

And we sold the second car

2009

And the first house

2010

And started renting in Sandymount 

2011

It's nice to go down there once in a while 

Escape the city

Sandymount traffic can be such a nightmare 

I always meet the Andrews mothers there 

That's why New Yorkers go to the Hamptons

On my way back I waited at the Dame Street stop for an hour.

I do want to challenge myself and learn about the world. I know a few Irish peeps who ventured over and never looked back. The Irish community is actually very strong all over the world and Singapore is no exception. \n\n4. Demographic shifts: it is kinda difficult seeing your peers come and go. Either to go home or venture onwards. My Irish friends (I am an expat here) all have their own lives, family and community outside work and as much as I love them,  I will not really fit in.

I’m not going to be able to buy a house in the city anytime this year and I don’t want to buy a house where I have to commute every day again and go back to that icky way of living, so the way I see it- the way to an enjoyable life is to pay higher rent and ask for more Money in work. \nThis rent situation can’t keep getting worse - there will have to be a crash or some sort of regulation change soon for rents- dublin is starting to win “worst in world”. \nSoon it just won’t be worth living in Dublin because all the fun young people will live an hour away, all the pubs will be demolished for boring hotels, the shops will be gone because we are only spending money on rent so sales are plummeting, so when this happens- it becomes a dull city and the young people will travel to a different one. \nThat’s a trend.\nThe other problem here is that the Planning Authority are taking no responsibility for stopping “build to rent” schemes. The American and Saudi companies are building these all over the world at the same time- just have a look around the world cities and check the developers names. They have already created a monopoly where cities which were traditionally cheap are rising. People don’t understand Monopoly- but it’s here.\nThis can be stopped by the Planning Authorities however- they are afraid that if they block “build to rent schemes” that the developers won’t build anything at all and increase the housing problem, because they will make less than 10% of the profits over time. These buildings need extortionate rent too because the building regulations are so hard to comply with that in 3 years after building they all discover a fault with something like waterproofing or fire stopping installations not being correctly installed. Then the developer has to reinstall it all and lose profits - that’s how the government get revenge. \nWhat the government actually need to do is loads more PPP schemes (where we give Chinese, Saudi and Indian millionaires an Irish visa for a million euros investment into a PPP scheme- this scheme is already in use in Ireland, just nobody talks about it for some reason) - but the problem with that is we don’t have resources or the wild interest of greedy developers to drive it. PPP schemes get driven by Local Authorities where the people work 9-5, take all their sick days as extra annual leave, have a 1 hour lunch and 2x 15 min tea breaks, and 70 “parent days” per child. \nWhereas private schemes are run by rich Americans who work 12 hour days with a coffee for  their 5 minute break in the takeaway cafe downstairs, 10 days in a row, who hire private project managers and pay them to ring everyone on the design team every day and tell them to work harder and faster, and then pay private contractors in design and build schemes. \n“Design and build” is the ultimate effective construction contract type for money saving in the long run.\nThe local authority on the other hand choose a traditional contract where the architect is the designer and then they go to “public tender” where they always pick the most incompetent and cheapest builder. “To get the best value”\nDuring construction the Firestopping is installed incorrectly and the waterproofing- because of the contract type- the designer (architect) says that the builder has to design the connecting detail between the wall they designed and the product that the builder chose (which has a special installation detail). (The Firestopping and waterproofing are here) This is the position of all future problems. The builder says I’m not a designer- the architect says it’s not designing when you join two different elements- the expert advisory team says “that is a design and someone has to design it” - the architect always wins the argument and the building always leaks and is built wrong. \nSo like- the hassle to build is heavy. The developers deserve this high rent because they are all gonna be screwed with defects in a few years time. \nOh wait - no- that’s why they are allowed to open up a new company for each huge project here- I forgot - the Irish taxpayers will pay for the defects when the stage name company can’t pay.\nSo basically the Americans take the profits and then transfer to “a management company” and wash their hands of the defects.\nSo my idea. Do PPP schemes but don’t dare pick the lowest tender with an architect - pick SISK to do design and build projects and hire private project managers on a bonus scheme to hit targets.', 'So I live in that area and that would be pretty normal/reasonable rent for the area for a one bed.

Your rent will be astronomically high and you will need that hefty income if you want to buy even a basic house in a safe, secure and convenient area.\n\n- there is a lot of anti-social behaviour (seemingly more since the pandemic started) and there seems to be very little being done about this. Those who commit crimes will very likely get away with what they have done due to a weak judiciary. The police know this too and are fed up with the slap on the wrist mentality.

I've heard it's actually been criminalized since 2017.",98.0,0.77,289.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"['Without making any assumptions, any judgements, and just answering the exact questions you asked:\n\nThe website should work just fine. Don’t worry about the legal situation, it’ll probably be fine. If anything happens, follow the usual response, which is don’t talk to the police without a lawyer present. The workers on the site are there solely to make money so don’t try to be super chatty and friendly. Nobody wants a bunch of spammy texts asking “how are you?” and other junk. They will tell you where and when to meet and any specific rules they have. Their fav clients will be the ones who annoy them the least.\n\nIf that sounds…transactional, well it is. It’s a transaction. The worker you meet will like you if you respect that they do this as a profession and aren’t there to be chatty and friendly, although they will of course make small talk to put you at ease. They will especially like you and remember you, and possibly give you preferential booking in future if you are hygienic, respectful, don’t overstep, maybe pay slightly extra as a tip if you can afford it but they don’t expect that, and most importantly don’t flake out on meetings. That last one is a big point. Flakey people get bad reps. \n\nThe most important thing is that you be a grown-up about this. Sex is something consenting adults have and sometimes money changes hands. If you’re too nervous, too shy, refuse to follow instructions, or otherwise give a worker a reason not to see you, that will put you in bad standing. Only look into this if you’re sure that’s what you want to do. If you book a meeting and don’t show up, you haven’t just bailed out of a fun time, you’ve cost that worker money. You wouldn’t cancel a musician or a dancer on the day of the gig and leave them without payment, you shouldn’t do that to anyone. If you believe it is ethical to pay somebody for sex, some people do and some people don’t, then it is only right to treat that person with the same respect you would treat anyone you hired for any function. A builder, a plumber, a singer for a party, whatever.\n\nHopefully my answer was both neutral and informative. If you decide against hiring someone but still want to have sex then I wish you luck with wooing somebody. If you decide to hire somebody then I hope you have fun, which will best be achieved through professionalism and respect.\n\nSource: discussion with multiple sex workers that I know personally', 'Relax, buddy.

This does not cause concern on it's own, however it is now round 9 and we have seen the likes of Longford and Offally (which I'm not convinced even exists) eliminated yet I could not spot a suggestion of Cork as far as the eye could see.

To my horror I discovered that this is because Cork have lived up to their name as the rebel county and have been banding together behind the back of the country to manipulate the vote in their favour (Evidence from r/Cork [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/na0eib/out_here_reppin/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/n9sl8o/thanks_to_the_last_thread_were_getting_voted_out/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/n9ehba/munster_nonaggression_pact_defending_cork_from/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) )

                                                                                     
                                                                                    
This treachery CAN NOT stand, our isolationism must come to an end now if we are to save the smaller innocent counties from the only group of people on this island that are almost as insufferable as us.
We have the superior numbers and our internet is faster, if we band together we can put an end to them once and for all.                        
                                       
1: go to the newest round of the vote (should be easy to find).  
                                                                     
2: downvote anything eliminating a county that isn't Cork (other than Louth maybe).  
                    
3: upvote Cork and spread the word of their crimes against the rest of the republic

If we act now we may be in time to save Tyrone in [round 9 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/na4jt2/round_8_has_claimed_cavan_and_all_the_people_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) if this goes on much longer they will become too powerful, they are already attempting to forge alliances with the rest of [Muntster](https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/n9ehba/munster_nonaggression_pact_defending_cork_from/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Most houses at 97m and the price went up by the grant amount over night. The drove up the price of second hand home....\n \nIn 04 they abolished the FTB grant and exempted FTBrs from stamp duty for property under 317k. I was looking to buy then and it caused panic as over night prices went from 240 for a house in Crumlin to 317500 because if you went to that first you more or less had the house if sonvdy out bid you they had to pay 10k stamp duty. That didn't last long and prices went over that. \n\nThen you'd no vat on new build apartments... \n\nDuring the 2000 the state stopped building social housing instead demanding developers set aside 10 to 20 percent for social housing. The result of that was the councils let go their own architects and project managers \n\nDuring the 2008 20013 crash Councils bought houses on the open market instead of building more so they kept the prices up by completing with ordinary buyers. \n\nThe FG government created tax loopholes so that institutions bought up blocks of distressed properties.

Best veggie burrito that I've had in the city is Mama's Revenge, on Nassau street. Get the sweet potato spread. But honestly these days most places do great veggie options so take your pick of nice restaurants and you should be able to find good food there.

I'll be relocating to Dublin in January and pretty overwhelmed despite my experience in these types of moves. I've previously lived in Brussels, Bangkok, Rwanda, and now I'm in Barcelona.   


Really excited to get back to an English-speaking country (that's the overwhelmed part - lots of stuff is written up and I know I'll get told to do a search to find it by sassy expats). 

I'm prepared to pay high rents (we have the same problem in Barcelona) and I'll live outside the city if I must in exchange for a good apartment with a nice work from home space for 2. Suggestions there are also welcome.  
However, given my travels and general adaptability - what should I be prepared to know about life in Dublin?  
And, since work is paying for relocation - is there anything I should or shouldn't bring from Spain? How's the cost of furniture, clothes, etc, should I just pay to ship instead of sell &amp; re-buy?",75.0,0.92,75.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"['Just moved to Dublin very recently from the US, here’s my experience:\n\nIf you don’t already have a European Driver’s License, it’s gonna be a slog. If you don’t need a car, you can probably rent pretty far out from Dublin. Arguably if you’re going to be WFH, why even look at Dublin? There’s lots of good places with much lower rents that still have good internet.\n\nIf you have someone locally that is helping you with the relocation, see if they can do the on--the-ground apartment hunt for you. We got extremely lucky doing this as it let us have someone put our application in and we got a place and a lease signed before we landed (which is unheard of if you’re doing it yourself, I think).  If you have pets … I’m sorry. The vast VAST majority of Dublin landlords won’t take pets.  My hunt went from “so many places to choose from” to “which of these three do I fight for” once I clicked “pets allowed” as a filter on [daft.ie](https://daft.ie).\n\nIf you’re moving into an apartment: Pretty much all apartments in Dublin come fully furnished. Most of them have black leather sofas, which I do not understand but have come to accept as reality. So unless you have furniture you are absolutely dedicated to, or spent a lot of cash on (sit/stand desk, etc), best to leave it all behind, IMO.\n\nAlso if you want to have a home office, you may wind up needing to put some furniture into storage, unless your landlord is able to move the mattress/bed frame out to clear the space. \n\nIn general Dublin is extremely easy to walk around in, I’ve found very few neighborhoods that feel unsafe during the day (I’m old and it’s cold, so who knows what the evening brings), and I suspect you’ll love being here.\n\nIf you need to get your passport stamped by INIS, I have terrible news for you, which is that getting an appointment sucks out loud because bots are stealing all the appointments. Been trying for 3+ weeks and have had my IP address blocked multiple times for clicking too fast, and can’t get in to get a stamp.\n\nUtilities are a little weird if you’re used to the US, but your landlord should be able to help with that, and since you’ve already lived a bunch of places, I imagine you won’t have any trouble there.\n\nand finally: if you use an iPhone, download the Met Eireann weather app, and google maps. The built-in iPhone map is absolute  trash for finding things in Dublin as it is not up to date and often says businesses exist that have been closed for years.', '* Start working on a driver license early. Insurance companies don’t like non-IE ones much. \n* Virgin Media and OpenEir Fibre are generally the best broadband you can get, as long as the place you are going to has them. \n* Avoid Eir Telecom if you think your mental health is important, OpenEir has other providers. \n* It’s hard to find a place to rent even when you have the money to pay. I had too many rejections and/or non responses. So, start early. Get a landlord reference letter from where you are now. Get a declaration from the company you work for. \n* Welcome to Dublin!', 'I hope you\'re not too discouraged by all the negative comments, I\'m sure it\'s not what you came here for.  A lot of the complaints are valid, but they amount to what I refer to as the ""craic tax"" - you can bitch and moan about them, or you can take them as a given and focus on enjoying the company of our uniquely funny people.  As an Irish native from the suburbs of Dublin who has rented in Australia, the Dublin suburbs, and now Dublin city center, here are my thoughts on moving to Dublin:\n\n\n\nThe quality and cleanliness of rental properties here was shocking to me compared to Aus. I\'m not sure what your experience has been in other countries, but be prepared to have to clean when you move in (even when you rent through a property management company).\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, I have never had a rental inspection in 3 years of renting in Ireland. This is nice if you value your privacy and want freedom to decorate, etc. For comparison, my Australian my place was inspected every 6 months by the property manager to make sure I wasn\'t damaging the place.\n\n\n\nHumidity is high in Ireland all year round.  You will need to open your windows every single day for at least a few hours (even in winter) to avoid damp, mold, and mildew. If you can, sleep with the windows (or at the very least the door) in your room open to avoid morning condensation in winter. If you get mildew or mold, chlorine spray works a treat and it\'s relatively cheap in Woodies (popular hardware chain).  If you can afford a dehumidifier and a condensation vacuum squeegie for the windows you\'ll be laughing.\n\n\n\nWhen you rent a property, your landlord is supposed register you with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  I suggest checking out the https://www.rtb.ie/ to see your tenant rights because Dublin landlords take the piss and you are relatively well protected as a tenant in Ireland if you know when/how to complain.\n\n\n\nThat RTB website will also explain the rules with Rent Pressure Zones (i.e. all of Dublin).  There are loopholes and landlords are bastards about using them, but you might save yourself from being ripped off by knowing your rights if they\'re semi-honest.\n\n\n\nBus services around Dublin are very unpredictable because the traffic in the city centre is batshit.  If you choose to commute at all, I recommend looking for property with rail links (DART, Irish Rail, Luas) to Dublin instead of bus links if possible.\n\n\n\nIf you end up living in the city centre, I also recommend investing the €35 in an annual Dublin Bikes subscription because cycling is 100% the most reliable way to get around the city in a predictable amount of time, and bike theft is endemic. Cycling in the traffic can be a bit intimidating at first, but once you get familiar with your routes it\'s really not too scary.\n\n\n\nIrish people can be difficult to befriend.  Everyone is very friendly and you\'ll find yourself having a laugh with strangers more often than in other countries, but we\'re not good about inviting new people to hang out.  If you crave close social relationships, the best route is joining a sports team or some kind of group that meets up to socialise under the guise of some other activity. I don\'t know what it is, but Irish people seem to be embarrassed about amitting they want to spend time with new people that they like.\n\n\n\nBest of luck with the move!', ""It'll be most similar to Rwanda just with worse weather"", ""Re renting: DO NOT GIVE ANY DEPOSITS UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE PROPERTY!!!\n\nMight sound obvious, but there's lots of scams going on and people get caught out all the time."", 'First tip would be to ignore the absolute eejits on here suggesting that Dublin is anything less than a solid modern European city.', 'Is work 5 days a week in the city center?

Whats worse is that car that pulled out is now only driving 89km/h for the next 25km so now the bus is going to be late at the next stop. Then some old bitch comes on and starts asking you stupid questions like ""does this bus go to Dublin"" even though it is painted on the side of the bus and she is standing at a bus stop for the bus going to Dublin. Then when you say, ""yes, come on im 10mins late, I have to go"" she decides that now that she has established this is the bus to Dublin she will go across the road to the car to get her bags and start hugging her family and saying bye to everyone.

I see how the post might be misleading - don't post in the heat of the moment I guess..

It's been more than just the above, folks started harassing us with racial slurs and comments like ""get off my island"" and then went on as to how international ""business people"" like us are a disgrace and so on...   Friend has a strong southern accent and darkish skin.

I've seen and heard very similar story's from friends and family lately around Dublin. Sure those folks are some cunts that are just looking for a fight but there is also nobody standing up against them.

Having said that, I’m at the stage in my life where I’m looking at buying my own house. Unfortunately, I can’t buy a house anywhere I’d actually like to live.

So, I’ve had to look elsewhere. I found a house recently in Corduff in Blanchardstown and it seems ok. It’s roomy enough for me and my partner to start a family and it has a garage which is good for me as I like tinkering with cars. The area does have that rough council estate architecture and lay out but it is clean with no graffiti anywhere or signs of fires being regularly lit. 

The house is more less right next to St. Patrick’s church in Corduff. This is an area with a bit of a reputation like mine but I want to find out if that’s a reputation that’s deserved or even accurate.

Me: I told him that I got the call about my phone number being missed use in Northern Ireland (*I purposely doing a fact check with this guy, as if it was official department, they would not correct me on this)

Scammer: whats your name?

Me: Kerry (Fake name)

Scammer: whats is your full name?

Me: Given my full name in Vietnamese (as I know noone will be able to write my name down, haha)

Scammer: but you said your name was Kerry

Me: that was my alias

Scammer: you are speaking to an officer, you have to give your real name. 

Me: I just gave you my real name, the other one is alias so I dont need to spell my Vietnamese name over the phone

Scammer: okay, did you lost your PPSN card

Me: no

Scammer: Seems like there might be a mistake from our system, could you give me your PPSN so I can check on why the system triggered for your case?

Me: No, i am not comfortable giving over the phone. Let me check your phone number on Google

just accepted a job offer in Dublin. As we all know the housing market is crazy and despite having a decent salary for a recent grad I´ll be looking at flat shares. What I wondered is that the norm in Dublin or how do Irish people do it?

Just asking since living in a flat share after university would´ve been seen as kinda ""weird"" in my homecountry, especially considering dating i.e.",71.0,0.94,61.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"[""Yes, it is 'normal' here. It is weird in my homecountry as well. Anyhow, you get used to it, you save money, you move in with your girlfriend/boyfriend at some point. Just have to accept this or pay a big chunk of your salary on rent."", ""yeah thats the norm alright.  I'm a 31 year old guy with a high paying job in tech, meaning most of my colleagues and friends are in similar positions, and I can count on one hand those who live alone (and if they do, they're in tiny studios).  \n\n\nIt's also a lot easier for locals to find places through word of mouth than it would be for someone from outside of Ireland, but you shouldn't have any issues.  Whats your budget for accommodation?"", ""Absolutely normal, I and all of my (late 20s/early 30s) friends share. It's just too expensive to live alone. I think as well, maybe it's a culture thing, but a lot of people don't like living alone and prefer the bit of company. Dating shouldn't an issue as long as you're respectful of your housemates."", ""It's definitely normal enough. You're likely to get a bit more for your money if you're willing to share. Better house with more space (than e.g. a studio), better mod-cons, maybe better location, etc.\n\nFor a super quick reference (and don't hold me to this :)) - \n\nRoom in a houseshare: €600 - 800.\n\nStudio: €800 - 1k\n\n1 bedroom apartment: €1.4k - 1.8k\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor something like that."", 'I’m in my 40’s, have a good job in tech and have to house share as well. It’s obscene that a grownup with a fulltime job can’t afford his or her own apartment because of pure unadulterated greed.', ""It's possible to get a place on your own if you think that's worth paying for. I live in a lovely seaside town south of the city and have a very nice, big one-bedroom flat with sea views. I had a 30-minute door-to-door commute to my city centre office, back when there were offices.\n\nBut the flat costs 45% of my after-tax salary. For me, it's more than worth it."", 'Yes, sadly it is the norm. Most affordable studio/one-beds are incredibly depressing and grim, and to get a nice on you are often looking at €2000. For the cost of a depressing studio you can get an ensuite in a very nice flatshare. So the quality of the apartment in flatshares is generally better for what you pay, though with the obvious disadvantage that you have to share.', ""Yeah same here mate and it's not even young professionals just graduated, the rent pricing here is surreal I moved over a few months ago started off in a house with 5 people sharing a bathroom for €900 with the perk that the owners god pissed in said bathroom in the dead of night.\nCurrently sharing with 5 others but in a much larger house.\n\nBut in terms of dating and living as long as everyone you're staying with is quite laid back only seen one major issue between two flat mates which got tense but one left on the end, no hair off my back when all is said and done."", ""It is the norm but I would advise you against it especially if you will be working from home due to the pandemic and can afford to spend more on rent. \nYou should know this already if you're employer is cool with you working from home even after the pandemic. Many workplaces started offering flexible workdays, too. I would honestly spend a bit more on rent to be more comfortable if you will be working from home, maybe look for places that aren't in the city center but have good transportation options.\nI also moved here from Berlin and there's no way to find a decent place for 900 like I had there. 😅"", ""What country/city are you from? Young graduates sharing apartments has been a thing in most modern cities since at least the second world war. I've lived for a while in various cities in Europe when I was younger and it was the same over there.\n\nI mean, bedsits were the most common form of accomodation in Dublin for grads before they were essentially banned years ago."", '[deleted]', ""At some point I was sharing with a well paid guy in his mid 40s. He had a very good position, earning probably around 80/90k. But he was divorced with two kids, paying 1600 for an apartment would be too much as he also needed a car to visit them and all. So yeah it is really common here unfortunately. If you don't have two salaries, like a couple, you don't really have a choice. At least for the most part of people.\n\nOnce thing I didn't see mentioned here : when taking an apartment you often need a reference from previous landlords. Which is a letter saying you are a good landlord etc It is not so common in France, I don't know if it is in Germany. And not having that could make it even more difficult to find a decent not-so-pricy appartement. \n\nIt is less common for sharing. So sharing would probably be much easier to find at the beggining, even if only for 6 months or a year."", ""Sadly yeah, before covid I was finishing my masters sharing with a senior recruiter, a guy working in insurance and a young accountant. I think in other cities we all would've been able to have better living conditions."", ""Sadly you're either sharing with someone or else living in a tiny hallway that's considered a studio apartment so sharing gives you better living conditions/space in here even tho that's still not promising much"", ""If you think about it, 55k-60k is a salary that lots and lots of people take years to get there depending on their profession, some not even get there so that's not only the norm for young professional but for older ones as well. I'm not from here and I find it very sad people in their mid 30s, imagine 40, sharing homes like that."", ""I would say yes, and no. Its normal at the moment because people have no choice, but without this current housing crisis it wouldn't be a widespread thing."", ""I'd recommend looking at the commuter towns (Maynooth,Kilcock, Lucan etc)   \nand seeing what you can get there, if you don't mind public transport."", 'Ya', 'Daft.ie']",124,True,flat share norm young professional,share,0.12125695732838582,0.5066732804232804

It was in a pretty healthy place before that. DME brought over a lot of the medium to big size bands and we'd still get the obvious Metallica and Slayers (RIP) of the world in the big venues. God knows what will happen when the smoke clears, though. Still, I'm hoping for some head banging soon!"", ""We were supposed to have the Sunstroke festival but then pandemic. But it's a good sign that a festival of this size may happen here soon fingers crossed."", 'So I’ll throw in my opinion late for what it’s worth. As you can see from the other responses there’s a mixture of opinions on what the state of the scene was pre covid. I’ve been involved in gigs and bands for over 10 years in Dublin and it was always hit and miss at times if you were into more underground stuff but it’s definitely been on a steady decline the last few years. \n\nAs you mentioned a lot of the smaller venues have disappeared. Whatever few rock/metal bars there were have pretty much came and gone with the exception of Fibbers. As for Fibbers it’s fine to head in there once in a blue moon but the  quality of bands overall is generally poor, with exceptions obviously. Most people congregate  in the smoking area, the door for which is at one side of the stage, so you have a constant flow of people in and out the door during bands which is very annoying. Also the crowd can be completely random in recent times. It’s questionable what venues will reopen after covid. For example, The Voodoo Lounge had been hosting a lot of gigs the last few years but there seems to be a tattoo studio/artist space there at the moment so I’m not sure if it will reopen. The smaller shows for doom/stoner/death/black had definitely become less frequent. There were still a fairly decent amount of bigger bands coming over but Brexit may affect that as well. It was only cost effective for a lot of bands to come over if they were touring in the UK but with the prospect of touring bands requiring UK visas I’m not sure what will happen.\n\nI imagine though after covid there might be some excitement and the scene might get a shot in the arm because of everyone being deprived of live music for so long but who knows. The opposite could happen depending on what venues/bands resurface etc.\n\nPre covid I had been going to London several times a year for a long time to see friends and gigs and to be honest Dublin is just not that great for nightlife the last few years. As someone else said the nightlife in general has been on the decline. However it does have it’s advantages of not having to travel too far to get to gigs and the scene being smaller means you see the same faces. Whether that’s good or bad is a personal thing. Personally I’ve been thinking of moving to another country for a few years because as much as I’ve loved Dublin it’s unfortunately lost it’s charm for me. Unless you’re coming back for family or personal reasons I’m not sure that I’d bother. It’s just too expensive to justify what’s on offer. The population of Ireland is smaller than that of London and we just dont have enough people to support the same type of underground scenes that can be found in other countries. However there are good people doing good things but it does seem to have become more disjointed in recent years.', 'Do you make your money from gigs or do you have a day job too?

I am at my wits end. All i want is a clean and pleasant environment to take my puppy out for a walk. It all came to a head today when I spent the better part of my afternoon walking around my estate picking up poo and litter in frustration after finding a dirt nappy left on the grass on our walking this morning. I ended up fillling two large plastic bags with rubbish, including a tampon, a syringe and needle, and enough poo to start my own mushroom farm. I cant believe there are so many irresponsible dogs owners and litterers out there.

Found a great article by Elsa Anderling from a few years ago: [https://outsider.ie/lifestyle/dog-poo-problem/](https://outsider.ie/lifestyle/dog-poo-problem/)

So what to do except chastise the offending dog owner if i catch them in the act or otherwise wish they themselves step in some other dogs shit and take it home on their shoes to ruin the carpet and stink out the house. I never wish ill on anyone but how do we get people to simply pick up after themselves and their pets!

Been a bit of a rigmarole really. I'll detail the whole process for us below. \n\nBasically we gathered up all the documentation we could (there's a list on the application form) collated, and ordered by year and type; proof of address, identity docs, references, proof of marriage etc and included an index to basically make it as easy for them as possible. Ended up being a pretty thick wedge of files. I would also recommend that you send photocopies and not the originals (except where explicitly requested like passports and birth certs) for reasons I'll get into. \n\nAfter collecting all those files there's a section that needs to be witnessed signed and they'll validate your original id documents, namely a passport, by a peace commissioner/solicitor/notary. The peace commissioner is the free option though an immigration or citizenship solicitor may be able to provide with some more advice or context if you like. We went with the Peace commissioner and contacted the local garda station for the details of the nearest one. \n\nBefore you send anything away, I'd photograph the whole collection of docs to prove what you have and haven't sent. Keep a copy of the index too\n\nWe sent the whole shebang away and shortly after (maybe a month, I don't remember) we received our passports and ids back and a citizenship application number - keep a hold of this obviously. \n\nWe emailed the citizenship office and, quoting the application number, asked if there was anything more we could provide or is everything there, but got a stock response that applications are worked on in chronological order, if anything else is needed we'd be contacted yada yada.\n\nAbout 3 or 4 months later got a letter back saying there was a section missing a signature and date from the PC (to be fair to him, the layout on the form is a bit confusing and we read it over ourselves multiple times and missed it as well) they also demanded even more documentation than originally requested. Some of the proof of address we sent on was original utility bills from 3 years so we couldn't prove we had already furnished that so was a bit of a pain finding more PoA. \n\nAdditionally, they already had our bank statements, but now they wanted statements that showed purchases in the country and not subscriptions or online purchases, so we got the same 5 years of bank statements, went through them and highlighted every POS transaction, cash withdrawal in the State for both of us because apparently it's too much work for them to do this. Filled out a whole new form as requested, with the missing portion completed, quoting the application number so it gets combined with the original, took it back to the PC got him to fill in all of his parts and then waited again. \n\nThis was Halloween 2019 as I remember the PC had his decorations up. Some time after this we had not received any word in a long while, obviously Covid had hit and everything so I can understand delays and so on. At some point during this period we emailed the citizenship office again and asked basically the same thing; is everything ok, do you need more docs etc etc, got the stock response again. Several months later, it could've been 6 months or even a year, it's hard to recall, we received some registered post and a letter that said they were returning our original marriage cert, my original birth cert and her original birth cert - except her birth cert, wasn't in the package. We took photos of the letter and envelope and emailed the citizenship office again about what we should do, and where is her birth cert. emailed response said it's best to contact the office in writing - so we did and then another 2 months later we received non-registered post with a torn birth cert (it was not torn when we sent it off mind) and another letter  stating please find enclosed in this registered post (again, not registered) your birth cert and instructions not to contact them again as applications are processed chronologically and contacting them only slows the process down... \n\nAaaand thats the last we've heard. My wife has a couple of friends in the middle of the process too but no word on where they are in the queue despite news reports that the dept was working to clear the backlog by summer of this year. She's basically given up at this point, despite my trying to keep her spirits up about it, though there's not much you can do to influence proceedings. \n\nHope that bible helps somewhat\n\nTL;DR - Send copies not originals where possible. Wait a long time. Triple check the witness' section, signatures and dates etc. Wait a long time. Have documentary proof of every everything you send to them before you send. Wait a long *long* time. Steel yourself for the usual bureaucratic incompetence the Irish Civil Service has elevated to an art-form.\n\nEDIT - Forgot to add, that at some point in the middle of this process some tool of a judge decided in the process of a case that if you leave the country for any period in the 'reckonable residence' term, that your application would be invalid and the required 3-5 year period would start again. So that held up all applications for about 3 months I think, until a higher court overruled the judge."", ""Do have a look at the rules from your home country too.

Generally there has been 0 communication and no way to know what's happening, how much more time is left - kinda left in limbo. \n\nAs far as the application itself, it wasn't too bad, the biggest hurdle is they need 3 different proofs of address for each of the years you lived here, so I had to chase old receipts / service companies to re-issue those. I know a lot of people who hired a solicitor for the process - but I didn't feel that was necessary, as the process and the form really isn't that complicated, at least in my situation (form 8). You do need a notary public to verify your identity though, I think that cost 70 eur or so. \n\nI'm probably still a year or so out of getting it if I had to guess - but as I said it's somewhat a black box.

I am a French student who will be spending 4 months in Dublin starting tomorrow for a semester of study. I will have to take the bus to get from the airport to my home and to my university.

Thank you !

Basically, I'm looking for a barbers in Dublin, having recently moved to Dublin 6W. My problem is, for years now I've had a pretty debilitating panic disorder, wherein when I'm in certain situations (barbers, train, plane) I get pretty savage panic attacks. This often leads to me feeling like I'll vomit, dizziness and on one particularly bad one, my hands and feet turned inwards. 😬

Anyway, I'm dealing with it and am doing quite well, but I'm currently a big yeti with my lockdown hair and I'm just wondering: A) does anyone also suffer from this? and B) if so, can you recommend any barbers that are pretty chill with letting you maybe pause for a moment/undo the neck-bib-thing/just generally understanding of the illness? 

I know most barbers are really nice when it comes to this stuff, it's just pure built up in my head now that every barber will be like ""whaaaaaaaat is wrong with yer man?""

I'm actually moving to Dublin in less than a week, but just gonna stay for two months. My SO is going to work with a project at the uni and I'm just going to be on parental leave with my two kids. The oldest one will actually go to school for two months, so that's nice.

I was in Dublin two years ago, just looking around, but there's some things I don't really remember. 

First of all, are Irish people sceptical about Swedes now? I've seen so much desinformation and rumours about the Swedish Covid-19 strategy and thought that it might be difficult for Irish people to trust us now haha. Even though I know that some of the most friendly people in the world live in Ireland (but maybe that's just a stereotype?).

Secondly, when I was in Dublin last time I got the feeling it's quite divided. On one hand people are very progressive and open-minded and on the other hand there's a lot of conservative people there. What's the general opinion about men/dads on parental leave? I heard you only have maternal leave in Ireland? 

I was thinking about bringing my cruiser board, like a skateboard with longboard wheels kinda. 4 years ago people on Reddit seemed to recommend places and skateparks, but since two years back the attitude has changed and now people just think Dublin being a shit town to cruise around in. What would you say now? Any public parks with good cykling paths? My oldest want to bring her kickboard/skate scooter, not to go to skateparks, but to get around. Do you think that's a bad idea? Also, how's the weather in October and November?

I mean you might, when you get talking to someone, have them ask about the situation there, but that might happen anyway.\n\nIreland has maternity, paternity and parental leave. Maternity leave is around six months, paid and paternity leave is two weeks and it is unpaid. Parental leave is longer-term and is also unpaid. Yes mostly it is women that take parental leave but it is up to a man to decide if he wants to take it or not. He has the opportunity to anyway. I'm not sure why most don't. \n\nI can't help you on the skateboard park thing except to say that you generally won't be welcome in cycle lanes. Not that it would be a huge problem but they're generally few and far between anyway and sometimes cramped.

You get people with all views, but the city is large enough that you can surround yourself with whoever you want to.

oe4omw,borgorop,t3_oe4omw,Dealing with sexual harrasment in the workplace,2021.0,7.0,5.0,"There's a colleague of mine in his mid-20s who has Aspergers that started work last September. Though he's a great lad most of the time and quite intelligent, he can say some really extreme sexual things if someone starts a conversation about something remotely sexual. In other words, he takes lad banter to an excess though never starts it

A few lads from work are also friends with some other girls from work. He has a crush one a few of them but has taken an interest in one. Conversations with them were normal at first but then he did weird things like staring at them for too long while at lunch. I didn't say anything but when one of the girls saw him and complained, I told him politely that they might not like it.

We were going on about who we'd like to date and he mentioned them and started going into detail about them and how they look like ""good specimens"". It all made us a bit uncomfortable but we laughed it off.

There's a WhatsApp work group and he started texting the one he liked on and off. It got too much that she told him that she had to block him. She told HR and they said they'd talk to him but they also couldn't do much as he has Aspergers

He stopped but then last week was too much. We all went to grab a burger in McDonalds and he told the girl he liked how ""I'd like to go on a date and spank your bum"". A few other lads laughed it off but all the girls looked uncomfortable. The girl who he told that too looked completely mortified.

She told me that she's considering either going to HR again or the Gardai. Would this qualify as harrasment serious enough to warrant Gardai intervention? I know he definitely could be put on probation.",45.0,0.89,34.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"[""I run a social group for adults on the autism spectrum and I was involved with supporting students with Asperger's at University. I am on the autism spectrum myself. I've had to deal with situations like this, in most cases just taking to them helped. There is also a non-zero possibility that I know this guy.\n\nI know that's not your job to fix this and you tried before, but I think sitting him down formally and talking to him might help. Does he have a key worker that will do this, maybe someone from EmployAbility? Also, HR should have helped, they are obviously not doing their job. Try them again.\n\nIf not, try talking to him. It's up to you though. If you feel a bit wary of confronting him, get a group of you to sit him down next time after work or on a lunch break. I have had to intervene several times in situations like this and most time Asperger's folks were receptive to feedback, once they know it's serious.\n\nExplain clearly what he's doing is wrong and why it's wrong. Give examples of his bad behavior, why he should not do these things. Also tell him that the girl he facies does not fancy him at all and there no hope in hell she will ever date him, be clear.\n\nI have also been told that writing down an agreement and signing it helps, it's a list of rules he must follow. People on the spectrum are very rules based and the often like lists, once they know the boundaries they don't cross them.\n\nHowever, a minority of people on the autism spectrum are quite sensitive to criticism, sometimes due to low self esteem, maybe linked to past school bullying. He may get defensive and e.g. complain that you're asking to stop talking to everyone. If you sense there's no effort to change, and indeed you already tried, elevate it with HR or who ever you or your friend feels is appropriate. It's not fair to be subjected to an uncomfortable work environment.\n\nAlso, here's Survival Guide For People With Asperger Syndrome by Mark Segar. He might find this helpful.\n\nhttps://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~alistair/survival/survival.pdf"", 'The right thing to do is go to HR. There are procedures to follow in circumstances like this and no, going to the gardai is not one of the steps. Harassment is continued events so this could constitute harassment, but she would probably need to show that she made it clear that she was uncomfortable.', 'As someone who was in the same position as your colleague in my own 20s, I can offer a personal view from the other side.  I was doing the same and never realized I was being inappropriate.  What did make me stop was very clearly defined rules for human interaction.  As an Aspy, I had a very low emotional intelligence, and I was unable to ""read between the lines"" or understand facial expressions or body language.  It took the HR to present me with a very clear and concise bullet list of things I was not allowed to do or say, have me agree to those rules, and I was good.  They then added one more rule: If it\'s not covered by these rules and you are unsure whether it\'s permissible, consult HR first.  This actually made me much happier: no ambiguity, and a good excuse to keep my headphones on and communicate with everyone in the office in writing.\n\nWe\'re all different, to I\'m not trying to excuse your coworker or minimize his potential threat, but I think that for us Aspies the biggest problem is ambiguity in human interaction.  We\'d be more than happy to follow rules, as long as the rules are clearly set up for us.  I ""grew up"" from the phase where I was being inappropriate, both thanks to higher age and more experience, and thanks to 11 years of therapy.  However, even years later, I\'ve been reciting to myself all the office rules I was given, every day during my commute to work.\n\n(And one other thing: the ""staring too long"" issue: that\'s something the guy may not be able to fix.  I still do that, even though much less frequently than before.  I simply sometimes get lost in my own head, and while I think of something, my eyes lock on one point.  I look through people, not at them.  I was also told I was making people uncomfortable with that, but I didn\'t even notice I was looking at that direction.  I can\'t offer any advice for this.)', ""Asperger's or not, that's inappropriate behaviour. People with Asperger's Syndrome can struggle to filter out what they say or can struggle with recognising boundaries (and that's often why they struggle to hold down a job or relationships for too long). The people who laughed at what he said in McDonalds need to not do that, they need to hold him accountable for it. Often times, a positive reaction to something like that can be reinforcing to someone with Asperger's, in that they recognised it as something that got a positive reaction and think it's something cool to say around the people he views as friends.\n\nAdvice: Take him aside and explain that what's going on isn't appropriate, advise he shouldn't say that stuff to the woman he likes and advise he steers clear of her as much as possible. Advise the woman that you've spoken to him and ask for some understanding/leeway, but if he does it again (or harasses her any further, in any way) to take it to HR and ask someone THERE to have a word with him. I'm sure there's procedures for that in your workplace."", 'Aspergers or not those women shouldn’t have to work in an environment like that.  \n\nWhile it’s unfortunate he shouldn’t be allowed work there really.

Regardless of what neurodivergence he may possess, if his actions are causing co-workers a great deal of discomfort, HR needs to deal with it.\n\nNow yes HR exists primarily to protect the company, but it's in their interest to deal with this effectively, because otherwise they get known as a company that is ok with sexual harassment, and lawsuits will be incoming rather thick and fast."", 'No idea about the Gardaí but keep in mind this is only stuff he’s done in public in front of you, I’d imagine if he has her personal contact details or sees her on her own it’s happening constantly and may be even worse than what you see. If your work refuses to help her then she might have no choice but to go to the Gardaí frankly. In the meantime, stop laughing it off. Call him out when he makes people uncomfortable. Aspergers might explain a general lack of sensitivity but it’s no excuse for him to be sexually harassing people when they’re trying to do their job. You and the lads need to take the lead on this, he obviously doesn’t listen to the girls. Stop laughing and tell him to pack it in.\n\nEdit: a word', '""Couldn\'t do much because he has Aspergers"" is complete bullshit. You don\'t get an exemption from the laws concerning sexual harassment just because you\'re on the Autism spectrum. \n\nThe woman in question should tell her HR department that if the guy continues to behave the way he is, she is reporting him to the Gardaí.', 'I really don’t think Asperger’s syndrome or being on the spectrum is an excuse for this behaviour.

To be honest what he needs is for the group to back off of this kind of behaviour in general around him, he also needs for his closest people in the workplace to have a talk with him and explain whats happening in that it can cause him a problem with HR and potentially a legal issue, probably losing his job.  There is nothing wrong with him having  a crush or even approaching a girl he is interested in, but he needs to know that there are things that are unacceptable in general, but in a constructive and polite way.  \n\nIf hes your friend it would be worth taking the time, with someone else present to have the talk with him and be plain and factual.', 'Stop laughing when he does it, you’re encouraging his behavior.', 'When I worked in UK my colleagues always told me about needing to go for wees like several times per day. “I’m dying for a wee.

qotfck,Royal_Web266,t3_qotfck,Is it safe for a wheelchair user to navigate Dublin alone?,2021.0,11.0,7.0,"Hey lads - not sure if this is the right place to post this or not but can't seem to find any relevant advice anywhere else so thought I might as well give it a shot. Any advice or contribution is welcome and if you have any questions about my condition / life in general I'd be happy to answer it. Would appreciate serious replies only! 

I deferred my offer to study in Trinity until next year and since then have been developing life skills that I'll need to live alone e.g. learning to cook with my disability, general wheelchair skills like doing wheelies etc. I've been to Dublin before with friends but will be travelling alone next week to see a friend whose staying here. I have free travel so I intend to rely on public transport to get around but obviously will need to push myself a bit unless I get a taxi. Ideally I would have a car but simply do not have the funds as I'll have to pay for accommodation myself out of pocket. Do not want to be getting taxis everywhere either because the money adds up. Frugal living and all of that you know?

My parents are quite hysterical when it comes to my safety and were not pleased when I told them I was moving away for college. I felt it was necessary for me to do so in order for me to develop independence as I've been quite sheltered up to this point. I have plenty of upper body strength so pushing has never really been an issue but as of yet I don't have the skills to get up curbes so I have to find flat and safe routes to navigate around. My Dad lived in Dublin for four years on George's St  in the 80/90s and says it is 'highly dangerous' and says I'll be an easy target for get robbed by the junkies. While I do agree with him to some extent, I can't help but feel like this is somewhat hysteria that fuels the narrative that Dublin is a horrible city which is perpetuated by us culchies. 

My opinion is that danger is going to be everywhere and cannot live my life in fear. My parents are pushing me to get a carer but honestly find that quite demeaning as you can imagine the frustration of someone following you around 24/7. Had ass-covering SNA's like that in school and they drove me nuts.  Granted I'm not oblivious that danger exists and will not be travelling late at night  and to have my wits about me etc but at the same time can't exactly run away if someone tries to attack me lol.

I will need to use Google Maps to get around as my sense of direction is shocking. My plan is to have my phone in my pocket and use bluetooth earbuds to hear the directions so it's not on my lap just waiting to be snatched. Don't intend to carry any cash with me - only having my phone, ID and debit card in my pocket. Is Apple Pay widely accepted? If so, I might not even need to bring my card as can just use my phone but if isn't then I will. Any other tips or ideas would be helpful!

I would just like some advice on whether Dublin is accessible in terms of foothpaths (flat areas, ramps if there are are curbes etc.) I know cities weren't designed with people like me in mind but it's more that there are alternatives ways around the place if that makes sense. I understand the logic that it's ideal to have someone with me but there are going to be situations where that is not possible and need to be prepared for that. I also want to be as independent as possible and having to rely on someone to be there with me when I want to go out just seems a bit depressing. I understand though if that what has to happen, but just wanted an objective view on it is all. Don't be afraid to be frank with your views either. A list of bad areas to avoid would also be appreciated. 

For context, will be taking the Red Line Luas from Heuston to Abbey St. at 9am and then going under less than a km to meet them at their hotel. Don't really expect to be many issues but just wanted advice about general travel and getting about more than anything. My dad offered to pay for taxis for the first few weeks once I start college next September 'so I can get my bearings' so like obviously I'm not going to turn down free money but would just like to hear your thoughts from anyone who has lived in Dublin for quite some time :) Apologies if this is a long read.",46.0,0.88,63.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,"['Every traffic light has a ramp.

There is a rise in panhandling and drug use, but it\'s more common in some areas, and you will likely not be in them, I\'d avoid nighttime isolation in areas of the city that are not main areas.\n\nAnd something to take into account, Dublin is a friendly place and you will likely be offered help if you need it, more so because of your disability. \n\nReach out to the student council and disability services for the college and ask for advice. \n\nCan\'t do anything about your parents, and as a parent of a child with a disability, don\'t fight with them over it, maybe see if you can come up with a trial, a few visits up and have a wander around on your own, but have them nearby incase you get stuck.

The main thoroughfares (O'Connell Street through to Stephens Green at the top of Grafton Street are pretty much 100% accessible except for McDonalds (both of them) on O'Connell Street as there's no room for lifts and you wont be able to get help up the stairs as they are too narrow. McDonalds in Temple Bar is difficult to reach unless you come in from the south side (to avoid the cobbles) BK on Grafton Street is accessible and the one on O'Connell Street more so. Pennys on O'Connell Street is easier to access than Mary Street (less crossings over tramlines) Ilac Centre is easy access, Arnotts too and Jervis is a little confusing but easy to access.\n\nthere are no accessible toilets in supermac's as far as I am aware/no way to access even a regular one or dining area.\n\nShakeDog in Ilac will bend over backwards to accommodate you, but they have raised booths... so might be difficult.\n\nIf you want me to explore for you accessibility, I will be happy to over the weekend coming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFir3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Ha'Penny bridge is completely impossible to cross unless someone carries you. and is unpleasantly steep... and stay away from Merchants Quay (After Dublin City Council) for your safety, follow the north side of the liffy then cross over at the metal bridge. when heading towards the east.

Sure it's more dangerous than rural Ireland, and there are homeless people/junkies, but in general they won't bother you beyond asking for spare change. I've lived/worked/studied in and around the city centre for donkey's years and only run into trouble on one occasion."", 'Main roads you’re fine, particularly in the city center. Side streets are an obstacle course—narrow footpaths, random drop-offs of the curb, electric, light, and sign posts, bin bags, proper wheelie bins, parking meters, etc. You’ll have to keep that in mind when google maps gives you a walking route. Or just go in the road tbh. Temple Bar is a no-go with the cobbles but that’s really the only cobbled area I can think of. Footpath parking is Dublin’s favorite hobby so make sure you’ve got a battering ram on your chair.', 'Yes, very.', ""I don't know if it's still the case, but as far as I know, you have to give 24 hours notice to get a ramp for the DART, and the lifts at the stations are often out of service, so you'd have to make sure it's all ok in advance.

Find out as much as you can from them. Also, get back to them when something is not working for you.

I use the parking tag website all the time to pay for parking, I hardly ever have change on me and its convenient.

It's a minor pain in the arse to have to enter your car details, phone number and card details every time but in hindsight its not that bad. I've done it that many times it usually takes about 30 seconds to fill it all out and pay.

I decided to give their app a try. I figured that if it saves me manually inputting the details all the time it then why not sign up.

Minimum deposit amount is ten euro (up to 200). Minimum account balance allowed is also a tenner (also up to 200, its beyond me why). I went through the sign up, topped up with a tenner then paid my 1.30 parking. I was then debited another ten euro because my balance fell below the minimum.

I'm not sure how I would be able to run down the account balance now, so I can eventually close it. Trying to switch to a revolut virtual card with no funds so they can't charge me.
